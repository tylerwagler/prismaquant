# Issue 183 bounded LFM campaign: actual run evidence

This is the append-only observation record for the opt-in run described in
`pq183-lfm-bound-plan-2026-09-05.md`. Acceptance 4 requires a completed actual
campaign, export, attested census, paired serving smoke, and matched byte and
identity records. A dependency check or CPU regression does not satisfy it.

## Attempt 01: producer environment failure before calibration

PB action `bf8fe2dfbc3c836436077db638c22bf1435de314b303f77cd5bf4c2baccb839e`
ran on sparklina with four admitted CPUs (5–8), 64 GiB aggregate memory,
three exclusive GPU slots, and native numerical threads limited to one.
It exited 1 after 81.26 seconds. PB recorded 19,399,270,400 bytes peak
cgroup memory, no OOM, and completed resource cleanup.

The real LFM2.5-8B-A1B-BF16 model loaded and enumerated three dense Linear
targets plus 96 projected expert units from layer 12. The next operation,
the existing `_calibration_tokens` loader, raised
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'`. PrismaQuant declares
`datasets>=3.0`; the producer image did not contain it. No calibration,
priced cost rows, exported artifact, census, or serving comparison resulted.
This attempt is inconclusive and does not establish acceptance 4.

The host harness recorded both Netdata endpoints (`http://sparky:19999` and
`http://sparklina:19999`) successfully, no telemetry-monitor errors, and safe
cleanup for every exact owned container. `campaign.pstats`, campaign and host
logs, image inspections, and `telemetry.jsonl` are retained. These are failure
diagnostics, not performance measurements.

## Environment qualification, separate from the GPU measurement

CPU-only PB action
`4f58ad3a72d5fe8223e705ed3a1b697e3b3dab9a299c329abdfb9f749d93d2d3`
attempted `datasets==5.0.1` while constraining every existing image
distribution to its original version. Resolution refused because the base
contained `fsspec==2026.7.0`, while datasets requires `fsspec<=2026.6.0`.
No image was published; its exact owned container was removed. The negative
receipt and resolution log remain under `environment-repair-01/` on sparklina.

The scoped follow-up pins `fsspec==2026.6.0` explicitly and retains all other
existing distribution constraints. It must check the actual before/after
distribution inventories and the unchanged WikiText train calibration contract
(eight sequences, length 512, seed zero) before publishing a derivative image.

CPU action `3740e7795eefb460dafdb71c8232fdfb3d1a2f1109d40fc8f8eb0d3f21cc9845`
installed and imported datasets successfully, but the unchanged calibration
loader failed: base `huggingface-hub==1.28.0` rejected the `wikitext` alias
with `HfUriError` requiring a namespace. No image was published. Its evidence
and exact-container cleanup are retained in `environment-repair-02/`.
The next qualification also pins `huggingface-hub==1.10.2`, matching the
existing host environment's dataset client. This changes the transport client,
not the calibration dataset or token draw.

The base's package metadata already reports a Torch/NCCL requirement mismatch
(Torch 2.13.0+cu130 declares NCCL 2.29.7; the image contains NCCL 2.30.7).
Dependency repair retains that existing native stack. Base duplicate `six`
distribution metadata also exposed an inventory ambiguity; later qualifications
record the complete distribution roster and use effective `metadata.version`
lookups for constraints, rather than collapsing duplicate entries arbitrarily.

CPU action `acabfd790fe0bb8c00248272a963478c2b654640b119838b5b6314eaaebca884`
then completed installation, imports, unchanged numerical-package checks, and
the actual eight-by-512, seed-zero calibration draw in 24.8 seconds. Its package
delta was exactly fsspec 2026.7.0 → 2026.6.0 and huggingface-hub 1.28.0 → 1.10.2;
new packages were datasets 5.0.1, multiprocess 0.70.19, pandas 3.0.5,
pyarrow 25.0.1, and xxhash 4.0.1. Torch 2.13.0+cu130, Transformers 5.15.1,
NumPy 2.2.6, safetensors 0.8.0, accelerate 1.14.0, and native distributions
retained their existing effective versions. The CAS receipt is
`f6ae50e84d10cc88a36846fc88e8fd2886d191b4f66fe8c760a5ca194ea09560`;
its 35,280-byte payload SHA-256
`c40955c511e6cdf59bba80fa48f87e29c7d1fe105b8ae4ee44fac3102325f16e`
was independently verified. Original evidence is `environment-repair-03/`.

CPU action `432058644465fd5a9806ab46a71c603ae1e07a7360b8e68390ed89250ddf9875`
baked that verified Hugging Face cache into `/opt/pq183-hf-cache` and reloaded
the exact calibration with Docker networking disabled and both Hub/datasets
offline flags set. The corpus and all eight int64 token-buffer hashes matched
the online draw exactly. It exited zero in 11.3 seconds, used two admitted CPUs,
eight GiB memory, no GPU, and peaked at 2,340,651,008 bytes. Exact owned-container
cleanup and PB resource cleanup completed. The CAS receipt is
`f80c543ac3f891ecb5bf4f9ecb47f698a5dfb4b68ab1f5388178af5b87a79a5b`;

`8b2eb95fae60061875b7ba9de2ddb0099b80a6f23b77294cd23416b8c1d2e0de`
was independently verified.

Final qualified producer image:

`environment-repair-04/` contains the final image inspection, cache manifest,
offline calibration receipt with individual token hashes, exact command logs,
and cleanup evidence. The image fixes `HF_HOME=/opt/pq183-hf-cache`,
`HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, and `HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1`; the host producer command must
preserve those settings. The source model and Tessera source were read-only
mounts during qualification. Container creation/installation/qualification/
commit all ran through PB; no daemon build or host environment provisioning
was used. The bounded derivation scripts and equivalent Dockerfile are retained
in `environment-repair-source/`, with immutable PB snapshots in the receipts.
The intermediate image `sha256:500117f774d8d89f187107cfc7363481e361558febd0de0d082e69c15cbdacdd`
is retained as provenance; the final image above includes the offline cache.

These CPU qualifications repair and characterize the environment. Actual GPU
campaign/export/serving acceptance remains pending a fresh reviewed run.

## Attempt 02: real capture exposed a parent-owned router bias

PB action `b47707a2f754eb71a78eb34ecd7a7aaea81b890d4d03d4660e57479898b6018f`
did execute despite an initially stale placement indication. A later withdrawal
request found it already failed; it was not a cancelled, unexecuted attempt.
Source parent was `3ac5f3c69782b5430b4a5804cc20451a67038e37`, materialized
snapshot `936259b853512f5e81fffc53191d59c35109dc93`, bundle SHA-256
`6e99d1de8fb4dacee586346c51b0debcc2052100aa9cd658d54d95e865a08306`.
It used the final offline producer image above, four CPUs, 64 GiB, and the
then-submitted exclusive three-slot GPU request on sparklina. It exited 1
after 30.31 seconds with completed PB resource cleanup and safe exact-container
cleanup. Both-host telemetry, dependency preflight receipt, actual campaign
log, and cProfile output remain in `run183-02/` and the local mirror
`pq183-evidence/run183-02/`.

The producer dependency preflight and actual offline calibration load passed.
During real model forward capture, `derive_per_expert_activations` replayed
the packed router without its parent-owned `expert_bias`. Transformers 5.15.1
stores that buffer on `Lfm2MoeSparseMoeBlock` and passes it to
`Lfm2MoeTopKRouter.forward(hidden_states, expert_bias)`. PrismaQuant's existing
adapter recognized only `e_score_correction_bias`; the missing LFM argument
caused `Tensor + None` to fail. No priced costs, exported artifact, census, or
serving results were produced. Acceptance 4 remains unestablished.

The bounded repair extends the shared router adapter and its three callers:
activation capture, packed-cost replay, and empirical down-input statistics.
It passes the original parent buffer to the model router, refuses a missing
buffer when bias is enabled, and retains explicitly disabled-bias behavior.

CPU regression used the actual qualified image and Transformers 5.15.1 router,
with a nonzero parent bias that flips selected experts relative to uncorrected
routing. It checks actual model-forward indices/weights, derived gate/up and
down-input rows, and empirical column statistics. It also checks disabled bias,
clear missing-bias rejection, and existing correction-bias handling.

- Red PB `6e958854678fc4d3302a80846038bf47ff70814ca3d703f47da5fa1ca6b12c12`:
  two intended failures and one pass, no skips. The real-router capture
  reproduced the exact `Tensor + None` exception before the fix.
- Green PB `c6f5d1ff7694a576078497966c1538b14c579f16153adc5ef71fa2acaf089c00`:
  32 passed, no skips, including existing packed-cost and empirical suites.
  CPU-only, two admitted CPUs, eight GiB aggregate memory, native threads one,
  and networking disabled. CAS receipt
  `b0eec7fe8591638083b14d6b934977aa7cb5a423c6d41e6caafa07ed4bac44b8`;
  independently verified 546-byte payload SHA-256
  `c04707642fbca02bb534ad6879b09603eeb325ef56920d1a2135ae220a0a64f8`.

Both CPU actions' terminal records and the successful CAS receipt are retained
in `pq183-evidence/`; the sealed test-only source and driver are
`pq183-router-validation/`. These regressions establish the routing repair,
not completion of the actual GPU pipeline.

Required architecture/staleness checks and source compilation passed separately
through CPU PB
`d3e11c503da0f8fe1ba2e85acf61eb95b5d3ce692bdf89fe526b0c60fa8317b2`;
the actual log and verified CAS receipt are retained beside the routing tests.

## Attempt 03: insufficient routed calibration coverage

PB action `874fe72da13a00e3c6bd18f67e339235e655a5feb64c55cf5962c9b347c76608`
ran source parent `4cb2084134133b3d487a1d01112e0055b541b186`, including the
routing fix merged as PR 247 (`8b16aef3`). Its materialized snapshot was
`53b210b0fb7d6f336f2bbcc51629af4fda8302f2`, bundle SHA-256
`1ee0e9557776242c0ede3b00bd873160dd530f1b039ce659811065e916b5b309`.
The qualified offline image and eight-by-512, seed-zero calibration remained
unchanged. The resource request used the fleet's current one-slot representation
of one exclusive physical GPU, four CPUs and 64 GiB on sparklina.

The router fix worked. Real calibration completed its forwards, then the
existing no-routed-rows gate refused exactly three units:
`model.layers.12.feed_forward.experts.2.{w1,w2,w3}`. Expert 2 received no
calibration tokens in this draw, so those three units had no empirical Hessian.
The campaign correctly refused a shared-Hessian or weight-only fallback; it
did not emit `cost.pkl` or start export/serving. This negative result establishes
insufficient coverage for the declared eight-sample campaign, not a completed
priced observation or a defect in the no-row gate.

The action exited 1 after 30.64 seconds. Both Netdata endpoints were recorded,
monitor errors were empty, exact-container cleanup was safe, and PB resource
cleanup completed. Logs, cProfile, dependency receipt, host state and telemetry
remain under `run183-03/`, mirrored in `pq183-evidence/run183-03/`; the failed
terminal record is retained beside them. Acceptance 4 remains open.

The existing CLI supports changing the calibration sample count but has no
per-projected-unit exclusion flag. A later larger draw, if run, must be recorded
as an explicit revised calibration contract, preserving the corpus, sequence
length and seed and retaining this eight-sample negative observation.

## Attempt 04: the explicit 32-sample draw still misses layer-12 expert 2

PB action `e6e110874a033c26ed2ce1c3cf715f418758839a5cdefbad710ab358ee63cecc`
used source `47a31e87b71c6d39109c6c730a3ca0a0649f717d`, materialized snapshot
`4ed7bf06e93f9eebde705911b88ad1cee3708860`, bundle SHA-256
`652ea18f28c005034f36539bbacae93d15c8f8705ee7c81d229a1135281cabc0`.
This attempt explicitly increased the calibration draw to 32 sequences while
retaining WikiText train, length 512, seed zero, maximum stored activation rows
512, the qualified offline image, fixed candidate, and all 96 layer-12 units.

It exited 1 after 33.95 seconds: expert 2 still received zero routed calibration
rows, so its `w1`, `w2`, and `w3` projections had no Hessian. The unchanged gate
refused before pricing, export, census, or serving. This result is insufficient
layer-12 coverage under the 32-sample contract; it does not prove the expert is
permanently inactive. No further sample escalation or fabricated fallback was
used. A subsequent actual-forward histogram is a coverage diagnostic, not
quantization-quality-based layer selection.

Original artifacts are in `run183-04/`; the submission is `pq183-submit-04.json`.
Both are mirrored in `pq183-evidence/`, along with the failed terminal record.
Both-host telemetry succeeded with no monitor errors, all exact-container
cleanup records were safe, and PB resource cleanup completed. Acceptance 4
remains open.

## Actual-forward coverage diagnostic and frozen layer-13 scope

The first diagnostic launcher, PB
`ad7284404af1cae07b7be070d23eaee05815fa5d3a3d34e9ad918bb2eb1cfbcb`,
omitted the sealed Tessera import mount and failed before model loading.
The exact container and PB resource scope were cleaned. That setup failure
is retained in `route-diagnostic-01/`; it produced no routing observation.

The corrected diagnostic, PB
`3a2f8a9fa5483aa439f0759cf1db3bc08710e2176f13d17652793102587bb182`,
completed in 30.0 seconds with exit zero. It observed the selected-expert tensor
returned by every actual sparse-block gate during the same 32 calibration
forwards. It used no router replay and retained no activation/Hessian cache:
only 32 int64 counts for each of 22 sparse layers, plus each actual parent bias
vector. Every layer's counts summed to 65,536 token-to-expert assignments.
The first eight token-buffer hashes matched the qualified eight-sample draw.

Among layers 13–23, every expert had nonzero support in layers
**13, 17, 20, 22, and 23**. The criterion declared before inspecting this
histogram was the lowest eligible index at least 13; therefore **layer 13**
is frozen for the next quantization attempt. Existing stride 13 selects dense
layer 0 and precisely that one sparse stack. This choice uses calibration
population support, with no quantization costs or quality outcomes observed.
Layer 13's least-observed expert had **13 routed rows**. Complete population
support does not establish a full-rank Hessian or certify quantization quality.
The existing required-Hessian and no-row gates remain in force.

The full 22-layer counts, bias vectors, 32 token hashes, versions and source
identity are in `route-diagnostic-02/router-histogram.json`, SHA-256
`d8ab6d0816a53a715596c0f4ff2ab28cf2895270668822aa93143d96819c1fc3`.
The actual checkpoint SHA-256 is
`c9b9e3c4b3be50b576e6da8c02de1b4223614ffe131d812abf92bb84421f6217`.
The qualified image remained unchanged; observed peak CUDA allocation was
17,409,684,480 bytes. Both Netdata endpoints were captured, the exact container
was removed, and PB resource cleanup completed. cProfile, telemetry, image and
container inspections, and full source binding are retained alongside the JSON
and mirrored under `pq183-evidence/`.

The successful CAS receipt is
`a1f4a3e97f1de3936772d823070ef336e407df5b96f3a335213f835bd1a24612`;
its 1,630-byte payload SHA-256
`c3fee81522061838c30835c22e340831e84801f4e4fc2e20799050b355e97bad`
was independently verified. The diagnostic establishes this scope-selection
criterion only; actual campaign/export/serving acceptance remains open.

## Attempt 05: complete bounded pricing, followed by an assignment-reader refusal

PB action `e9e2588f14bf9d4663b9a95ab0662407bf8a757682036a38c925e2947fab718b`
ran source `6ccb97e0ea8482353ab014e263a53dbeae076c06`, materialized snapshot
`07a9771e57e6442bc6ae2ed5de16b40f4e4adb68`, bundle SHA-256
`14b47d22982398de9a824e58b28fc013a767a18405e848be48a8b54ac2884002`.
The source includes the coverage correction delivered as PR 243
(`195f3ba754f4f4efdcbcfcc7a5aecd76d7b9acda`) and the routing correction delivered
as PR 247. The frozen layer-13 scope, 32-by-512 seed-zero calibration,
maximum 512 stored activation rows, required Hessians and qualified offline
producer image remained unchanged. PB admitted one exclusive physical GB10
GPU, four CPUs and 64 GiB on sparklina; the runtime target was TP1, eager,
resident, on the pinned EUGR image.

The campaign exited zero and priced all **96** expert projections at the
predeclared `TESSERA_E4M3_K1_R1024` rung. Its population receipt separates
96 priced routed units, zero unpriced routed units, three enumerated but
unpriced dense units, 27 dense targets outside the stride, 42 packed parameter
tensors outside the stride, and 36 pinned targets. The 42 count refers to
packed tensors, not stacks. The saved assignment explicitly retains 2,104
other body matrix units in BF16, including the three in-scope dense units.
There is no claim that those retained or omitted units were empirically priced.

The 96 selected projections contain **352,321,536 quantizable parameters**.
Their priced cached wire blobs total **178,161,760 bytes**, corresponding to
**4.0454355875651045 bpp over those selected parameters only**. This excludes
BF16 regions and export framing and is not a whole-model bpp figure. A
read-only SHA-256/length audit of all 96 actual cache blobs matched their
unchanged assignment records exactly; its roster is
`pq183-evidence/run05-priced-cache-readback.json`. The original assignment
SHA-256 is `d9b07632f6aebb3e9a29722312ae68e064de5925ac2accf5c262d1444036e66c`;
`cost.pkl` is 434,319 bytes with SHA-256
`45b3d9307a16a031445fa61d5e6e8374da6f0c893937384d9414c07648fe4656`.
These are priced cache bytes; exported and served byte identity remains
unmeasured at this point.

The subsequent fresh export process exited 2 with
`unsupported format string: 'TESSERA_E4M3_K1_R1024'`. The shared layer-config
reader accepted Tessera dictionary entries but omitted their saved string
representation. No `build.json`, export, census or paired serving result was
produced. The overall PB action exited 1 after 356.74 seconds and has no
successful CAS receipt. Campaign, preflight and host logs, cProfile, both-host
Netdata telemetry and exact cleanup evidence remain under `run183-05/`,
mirrored in `pq183-evidence/`. Both telemetry endpoints succeeded without
monitor errors; all exact-container cleanup records were safe and PB resource
cleanup completed. The successful campaign cache is retained for a separately
sealed continuation; quantization need not be repeated to repair this reader.
The first logged anchor took 78.8 seconds; subsequent logged anchors at indices
10 through 90 took approximately 2.3 seconds each. These phase observations
are not a comparative performance claim.

## Shared assignment-reader regression evidence

The repair is production commit `08d372be79312effe7ced43cb1bfd404f80dcdff`.
It accepts the saved Tessera rung string through the existing torch-free
reader and requires a full grammar match in both string and dictionary paths.
Rung legality and target admission remain with the existing downstream gates.
A malformed dictionary ending in a newline previously passed the anchored
regular expression; that adjacent reader defect is corrected in the same
commit without changing valid dictionary case policy.

The first two attempted test launches (`aeeecb4451c1` and `02e65c3d2d2c`)
failed on missing numerical dependencies during collection and are retained
as environment failures, not regression results. The isolated torch-free
reader regression then demonstrated two intended failures and one pass in
PB `2bd7dbaeab5a5fd7e64134f88275f520f99f54781d7c21e31a0bbbe4d6055ac0`.
Its initial string fix passed all three tests in PB
`43740749b568ed9e1e10b9035c0f2290542e325794ef24a7be5b703885562c39`.

The added malformed-dictionary regression failed specifically on the trailing
newline in PB `3060a29289e9d86bb9879c95601d8f17fb7efcbc22268d126ab47bd8f6d55a1d`
(three passes, one intended failure). After the full-match correction, PB
`3dfef54a381f9fb4348ea3c87d1a3b6195d2db076418588fa2f3c15392f0fedd`
passed all four tests with zero skips and compiled both touched Python files.
This portable CPU action requested one CPU and 1 GiB, bounded native threads
to one, and was placed by PB on dl380g10. Actual terminal logs and CAS payload
were inspected: receipt
`62aacfa7d2160faabcde5acef69584461da70cdde136a68e589f1785aeba1ce9`,
102-byte payload SHA-256
`8446de9e69a8e2e2a9f5bf70c127c4f325e091ab1d98b3489fdd8b8d2d912b19`.
The tests isolate the actual reader from the package's numerical initializer;
actual assignment/export preflight remains a required first stage of the
continuation. Acceptance 4 remains open pending export, census and serving.

The bounded publication copies for the completed pricing and export refusal
are retained in [the artifact roster](artifacts/pq183-lfm-bound-2026-09-05/publication-roster.json).
They include the full fixed recipe/population, all 96 priced wire hashes,
22-layer routing histogram, campaign/preflight commands, dependency receipt,
host cleanup/telemetry status, failed terminal and final parser CAS receipt.
The roster records the original archive SHA-256 and published SHA-256 for each
file. PB scope-token values were redacted before publication, including the
terminal's `resource_scope.token` and `detail.argv` value after `--token`;
the unmodified terminal remains in the private archive. Binary cache/Hessian
and profiler payloads remain archived and are not copied into Git.

## Attempt 06: actual preflight passes; receipt construction needs no Git executable

The shared reader repair was delivered in PR 249, merged as
`cb517da154b274c61e53b151f7a08312d1c57c18`, after 50 integrated tests passed
with zero skips through PB. The opt-in continuation retains campaign 05's
exact cost, assignment and recipe, without calibration, allocation or
quantization. CPU PB action
`799ba1ff56d191d9dae6fd14c58e6c1dccd7b63dfe11534972a8c566852d4567`
sealed 106 consumed files, including all 96 priced wires and the Hessian plus
provenance. The input manifest SHA-256 is
`99cc6100daa968aed8d7b7a357783bb439ce760732a7296c67e9415945f5f819`.
Its actual terminal and 208-byte CAS payload were verified; receipt
`fb6c5ece985e27817c6baa4e04318177c0f4539873869f4b47d6627d3ccb96c1`,
payload SHA-256
`add0e75c565440cb56f15df53c0e813a8efe7c40861045fc388499d68a075986`.
The CPU preparation used one CPU/4 GiB and retained the original absolute
campaign path because that local output is its concrete input dependency.

Continuation PB action
`51421c470ee9597240fd063c13992cb478b3d75958471f81ec3629d5376bf24c`
used source `03909b705516babc5e989899824dd216f07c48d3`, snapshot
`782581a0aed1de191cb80d259afd7816dc157d58`, bundle SHA-256
`5c4542414d3831925825ce3b27bd607b0137252c62cb30de2c23b00b3d2a2fbe`.
The original campaign was mounted read-only. The actual shared export
preflight accepted its unchanged assignment, Hessian, serving scope and all
96 priced wire receipts, writing `continuation-preflight.json`. The existing
cached-unit writer then wrote the fresh 96-unit transport bundle and
`build.json`. The copied cost, assignment and recipe SHA-256 values matched
the originals exactly.

The producer next failed at continuation receipt construction because it
invoked `git rev-parse HEAD` inside the qualified container, which has no Git
executable. That command was unnecessary: the admitted host already records
its exact source snapshot. This is an opt-in harness dependency defect after
successful actual preflight; it is not a quantization or parser failure. No
export, census or serving observation was produced. Repairing receipt source
binding must retain the qualified numerical image and use the host's existing
verified source identity, with missing or malformed identity refused.

The overall action exited 1 after 12.22 seconds, without a successful CAS
receipt. Both Netdata endpoints succeeded, monitor errors were empty, exact
container cleanup was safe and PB resource cleanup completed. Scope telemetry
recorded peak memory 2,810,134,528 bytes and no OOM. Originals remain under
`run183-06/`, with terminal and outputs mirrored under `pq183-evidence/`.
Campaign 05 and its sealed input manifest remain unchanged. Acceptance 4
remains open until actual export/census/paired serving complete.

## Attempt 07: the pinned planner requires dictionary representations

The missing-Git repair passed 11 portable PB tests with zero skips in action
`156ee8dd45998f61f05fdad91066634a78ac92f78a520d1913feb9d393c1c4a0`.
The 110-byte CAS payload SHA-256
`513cf626d88cdb96b14fcef97620f886418a43dc67a946d0147db17aab19086d`
was independently verified. Its negative cases refuse missing, malformed or
misbound host source identity before producer work, and its transport case
succeeds with Git explicitly unavailable.

Continuation action
`7cac236ac42bae7ceae2a3396f692ebdddfd3836f56361349f11fc084347d19d`
ran parent `85de9773ae644d26caa5f3b5e5101b623ca020f3`, snapshot
`26d00459662f3f7c703bab4eb7ef9c1c0315ea6a`, bundle SHA-256
`cd41a7aa2204c78922af872d4c342a639fb171e0f394ca70cc92e0f2e8764a4c`.
Actual shared preflight, all 96 wire copies, cached-unit build and continuation
source receipt succeeded. The new source receipt binds that exact snapshot
to the unchanged campaign-05 snapshot and input seal. Cost, assignment and
recipe copies again matched their original SHA-256 values exactly.

The pinned Tessera `experiments/plan_from_layer_config.py` then refused all
96 Tessera strings as non-Tessera quantized choices. At pinned commit
`ba582d476a3b6db9057ebd1385dc52926f171451`, `parse_entry` lines 153–154 accepts
BF16 strings and classifies every other string as `other`; its Tessera grammar
is reached only for dictionaries. This is a producer-reader representation
mismatch, separate from the repaired PrismaQuant reader. The planned repair
uses PrismaQuant's existing registered format serializer to derive a separate
planner input and proves canonical assignment/metadata equality. The original
assignment and pinned Tessera source remain unchanged; unsupported-format
refusals and all numerical gates remain in force.

The action exited 1 after 13.28 seconds without an export, census, serving
result or successful CAS receipt. Both telemetry endpoints succeeded, monitor
errors were empty, exact container cleanup was safe and PB resource cleanup
completed. Full `plan.log`, command, source/build/preflight receipts and
terminal remain in `run183-07/` and its `pq183-evidence/` mirror. This attempt
performed no calibration, allocation or quantization. Acceptance 4 remains
open pending the remaining actual stages.

## Producer-owned plan and transparent direct-export finalization

Before attempt 08, source review identified two more concrete interface
assumptions. The pinned dense plan translator emits routed expert leaf names,
whereas the exporter accepts the producer's whole-stack unit and refuses
routed leaf overrides. Also, the direct exporter writes its actual plan but
has no `export_identity`; the bounded census gate previously expected that
field from merged exports. No partitioning or distribution was introduced to
work around either interface.

The bounded harness now obtains source classification and stack geometry from
the pinned producer's `quantizable`, `expert_stacks`, `packed_expert_stacks`
and `project_expert_plan` APIs and uses PrismaQuant's existing
`stack_plan_request`. It requires the complete re-derived projection to equal
the priced producer projection and retains the original assignment unchanged.
The resulting serving plan names the selected stack at its measured rung,
66 ordinary dense tensors and 21 other stacks explicitly at BF16, and records
22 producer-classified routers that the exporter always retains at BF16.
This is the bounded measurement handoff. The ordinary pipeline still invokes
the dense translator; its routed-plan/representation fix and pin integration
are tracked in [Tessera #363](https://github.com/RobTand/tessera/issues/363).

The direct finalizer validates the producer's published plan against actual
plan bytes and calls its existing `validate_explicit_plan` over actual modules,
configuration groups and source tensor roster. It verifies complete source
identity against the priced projection, preserves the original manifest
outside the checkpoint, and appends an explicitly versioned direct-export
identity before artifact sealing or census. Its producer image is the actual
47dd image; its serving target is the pinned EUGR image in a separate field.
The record binds the export command, build, Hessian, cached-unit manifest,
full Tessera source seal and PQ host snapshot. It makes no partition or merge
claim. Census hashes and reads the same augmented manifest bytes; there is no
shadow manifest, gate override or fabricated producer runtime identity.

The direct-shaped regression first reproduced the absent `export_identity`
KeyError in PB `fab0180f2396c75a4f01a4e67d0f1bd13316fb429fc8399a3b98dc6a7a29524f`
(seven passes, one intended failure). After integration and stable module
imports, PB `7a69be4f27b1dd2d7cee3c4ed15ecf9aa0bcb139657e02b174d4873a0ad48e42`
passed eight direct-finalization and 15 continuation fixtures, zero skips,
plus compile checks. The fixtures check provenance mutation order and refusal
contracts with stubbed numerical/producer boundaries; they do not certify
actual exported bytes. Its 220-byte CAS payload SHA-256
`71eff40aebedb97ae7cfdfcba4b3085bd79d05ca09e3e4adba5ee0d22c7b4f42`
was independently verified; receipt
`6b027f9301bdad4503440e825c51172176dcc50698a7044907507d9f1da5adb3`.

A separate CPU-only PB action,
`3eea10b7b333a4aebe009d95de950c62c752c16c975e6f74408680006bcb7c06`,
then exercised the actual new plan helper against copied run-07 assignment
and build bytes, real model headers, and real pinned producer APIs inside the
qualified 47dd image. It asserted that CUDA was unavailable, used two CPUs
and 4 GiB, and performed no calibration, quantization or export. It passed,
producing exactly the scope above and plan SHA-256
`4361ef9ccb7cf6a4bb50f0c759d1480a6c5ea0d06fdcad84add01aaffd26c95c`.
The 317-byte CAS payload SHA-256
`ad231eb04cc240a700f6eb5b1c2c8256a9c3c80b46f32bf94baf2361a867ef41`
was independently verified; receipt
`b83f13659c9d8a89adaa2fdb40c0fa35ee8abb7901db4677e8ae0b2ed8ad938d`.
Actual artifacts and image/source receipts are archived in `plan183-cpu-01/`
and mirrored under `pq183-evidence/`. This qualifies plan construction only;
actual direct finalization and serving remain required.

The retained campaign profile attributes 76.190 seconds of cumulative startup
time to behavioral encoder identity fixtures. Its performance follow-up is
[Tessera #364](https://github.com/RobTand/tessera/issues/364); no new performance
experiment or guessed compilation/saturation explanation is claimed here.
The published PB generation's omitted required documentation is tracked in
[PrismaBuild #196](https://github.com/RobTand/prismabuild/issues/196).

## Attempt 08: actual exported bytes match, then host readability refuses

PB action `8dc3bc2e4ea62c4797b8519fda133328ae7ae9d72147ec03f0553d5053e0238c`
ran source `465fc13796abb0d5eeec1b3e93036478cd74fdaf`, snapshot
`1675e1368b42748547c1b21967daaa9dfc17c408`, bundle SHA-256
`a1933620df872cc7405ab4ff88fc1e6781111596a8115c93a89c6ed46f7bd9e7`.
Its cached export completed: one selected routed stack, 32 experts and
96 projections, with 2,016 other expert tensors retained BF16. The direct
producer wrote 2,302 tensors into a 16,409,528,112-byte safetensors shard.

The actual wire audit parsed every selected exported container and matched
its embedded blob byte-for-byte and by SHA-256 against its original priced
cache record: **96 blobs totaling 178,161,760 bytes**. The 96 exported fused
containers total **178,164,864 bytes**, including their additional framing.
These are distinct accounting scopes. The producer separately reports
`totals.wire_bytes=178094080`; that narrower field is not substituted for the
priced self-describing blob comparison. It reports 352,321,536 selected
quantizable parameters, 353,042,432 resident-mode bytes, and 16,231,072,000
BF16 passthrough bytes. None of these selected-unit bpp figures is a
whole-model compression claim.

Direct finalization succeeded with its explicit producer/serving-image
separation, preserved original manifest, validated source/plan and augmented
manifest. The producer wrote `wire-audit.json` and `artifact-seal.json` and
exited zero. The actual checkpoint shard SHA-256 is
`4924daacfcd4e2779fa4a673abcb38a2fbfa0c41f85df74c4bda495d5d0573c1`.
The host's next pre-census identity read then failed with `PermissionError`:
the shard had mode 0600 and owner root:root, while the host verifier runs as
rob. Other exported files were readable. No census or serving occurred.

The overall action exited 1 after 123.83 seconds and has no successful CAS
receipt. Both-host telemetry succeeded, monitor errors were empty, exact
container cleanup was safe and PB resource cleanup completed. Peak scope
memory was 22,230,003,712 bytes. All metadata, cached wires and logs are mirrored
under `pq183-evidence/run183-08/`; the unreadable 16 GB shard remains intact in
its original remote directory and is not included in that mirror. Its full
producer-observed hash remains in the seal. The original campaign 05 and
attempt 08 artifact permissions were not changed.

The scoped repair sets only newly exported regular safetensors shards to
0644 before sealing and records their before/after modes and independently
computed equal byte hashes. PB
`bd10c98f491c63cb5ef57638e3b38e8c32b88c3f8da8f98386c27fc57dadd3c1`
reproduced 0600 rather than readable 0644 (one intended failure, eight passes).
After the repair, PB
`fdb18fe67deaffe0a776fa63f4d653bdb4302776c7f8b8905a6bf223e16c06ea`
passed nine direct-finalization plus 15 continuation tests, zero skips, and
compile checks. Verified CAS receipt
`068e208d84366500feaa5ccea2af62651d1ccb60ac5b6dd29b73c9a6937d3462`
binds a 221-byte payload, SHA-256
`d36bcbf55f82020d01d0b9ca9ac48748f8620624f870a4a50787442873e6598a`.
Fresh continuation 09 keeps the existing deterministic graph and original
priced cache, repeating only cached export and the remaining validation.
Acceptance 4 still requires actual census and paired serving.


## Attempt 09: bounded priced-to-served handoff completed

On 2026-09-06, the unchanged 96-unit campaign from attempt 05 completed its
cached export, attested resident census, paired greedy smoke and final artifact
check. This supplies acceptance 4's bounded actual measurement. It does not
promote the format, certify model quality or performance, establish allocator
optimality, or fix the ordinary pipeline's producer-plan translator.

PB action `b25114fe9341bf4408a83e6a17aa5f2511c08cb5a17bc2ac210b8a49d4b823f9`

The source includes the coverage correction delivered by PR 243, parent-bias
routing correction delivered by PR 247 and shared format-reader correction
delivered by PR 249. Producer image 47dd, serving target EUGR 0afec, complete
Tessera source ba582d47 and the 106-file campaign input seal
`99cc6100daa968aed8d7b7a357783bb439ce760732a7296c67e9415945f5f819`
remain the identities recorded above. No calibration, quantization or allocation
was repeated; original cost, assignment and recipe bytes remain unchanged.
Every continuation phase verified the original consumed input seal again.

The frozen calibration remains WikiText train, 32 sequences of 512 tokens,
seed 0 and at most 512 activation rows per unit. Layer 13 was chosen before
quantization by the documented lowest-eligible-layer criterion. All 32 experts
were observed, with a minimum of 13 routed rows; that is population coverage,
not full-rank Hessian evidence. The measured scope is exactly 96 projections
in one whole routed stack. The original assignment retains 2,104 other body
matrix units as BF16. Its population separately reports three in-scope dense
units without admitted priced rows, 27 omitted dense targets, 42 omitted packed
tensor targets and 36 pinned components. Packed tensor targets and expanded
per-expert matrix units use different counting scopes. None is silently counted
as measured. The producer-owned serving plan contains the selected stack,
66 explicit ordinary BF16 tensors and 21 explicit BF16 stacks, with 22 classified
routers retained implicitly as BF16.

### Exact bytes and direct-export provenance

The post-export and post-serve audit passed all **96 units**. The priced
self-describing blobs total **178,161,760 bytes** and equal the embedded exported
blobs byte-for-byte and by SHA-256. Their fused containers total
**178,164,864 bytes**. Over the 352,321,536 selected quantizable parameters,
these are respectively 4.0454355875651045 and 4.045506068638393 bits per
parameter. They exclude immutable and retained BF16 regions; they are not
whole-model bpp figures. The producer's narrower wire accounting and resident
mode totals remain distinct, as recorded for attempt 08.

The final `exported/model.safetensors` contains 2,302 tensors and
16,409,528,112 bytes. Its actual SHA-256 is
`4924daacfcd4e2779fa4a673abcb38a2fbfa0c41f85df74c4bda495d5d0573c1`,
identical to attempt 08. The direct-finalization origin records mode 0600 to
0644 and identical before/after byte hashes. Only newly written attempt-09
shards were made readable; original attempts 05 and 08 remain unchanged.
The general producer handoff defect is tracked in
[Tessera #366](https://github.com/RobTand/tessera/issues/366).

The transparent direct-manifest supplement binds the actual producer image
separately from the serving target, validates actual source/plan/command/build
and priced input identities, and preserves the original direct manifest outside
the checkpoint. The actual augmented manifest is the one sealed, read and
hashed by census. No partition, merge, alternate verification manifest or
Tessera-source modification was introduced. Final artifact-seal SHA-256 is
`e059d31dacc7a9d77b40479395d2fe50b0b69c02b1f5666fe91f52e9d70692ca`.

### Actual serving observations and limits

The route census returned `served`; the unchanged ts5 gate returned `passed`
with `require_attested=true`, resident mode and 96 expected projection units.
It observed one `TESSERA_FP8` routed-MoE owner in both prefill and decode,
`vllm.fused_moe.modular_kernel:TRITON`, contract `fp8_per_token_dynamic`, decoder
`torch_materialize_stock`. Recorded shapes were M64:N3584:K2048 for prefill
and M1:N3584:K2048 for decode. This is an actual owner/topology observation,
not a throughput comparison or proof of saturation.

Both serving arms have complete build identities in the pinned EUGR image,
vLLM `0.28.1rc1.dev397+gfd4a15126.d20260904`, with eager execution and no compiled
forward. BF16 build fingerprint:
`a9742a32bee8db4f31c90a0e7941127e76df9dfcf10ecef9998356cfefbd2bcd`.
Tessera resident build fingerprint:
`1473ade26775c434eb5aba280c800f263ec16770cfc9af4efe6571c23366df17`.
The paired instrument used the same seven prompts in campaign and pure-greedy
forms, 14 completions per arm. BF16 recorded eight repetitive and six recorded
completions; Tessera recorded seven repetitive and seven recorded completions.
All six chat-template observations per arm were recorded. The remaining raw
completion repetition is explicitly retained. The existing paired contract
returns `recorded`, attribution `shared_with_reference`; this is not a claim
that all outputs are non-repetitive or that quantization improved quality.

The final `artifact-after.json` reports `accepted=true`, `unchanged=true`,
`smoke_status=recorded` and `quality_promotion_claimed=false`. It binds the
actual census-check SHA-256
`70aa3ac2602d5948a3c3d0935186d8a9d9b20278e0e8efcb3d1cf4e210e12a69`
and paired-smoke SHA-256
`76b9e48ab77cc0b05b52d588f56bd09578cccb34a07b181c38362c355e9e773b`.
The before/after source and artifact identities passed around serving.

### Terminal, telemetry and retained deliverable

All six host phases exited zero. The final PB action exited zero after
731.19 seconds, with cleanup complete, no OOM, no monitor errors and all five
exact owned containers safely absent. Its 4-CPU, 64-GiB exclusive physical-GPU
reservation preserved PB affinity `[5,6,7,8]`. Producer and census native
threads were bounded to one; smoke retained its existing launcher policy within
the same four-CPU cpuset.
PB scope telemetry records 776.00 CPU seconds and peak accounted memory
24,325,054,464 bytes. This is PB's scope accounting; independent host memory
telemetry is retained separately and is not equated to that peak.

Both hosts supplied 67 nonempty Netdata samples. The retained 125,586,882-byte
telemetry stream has SHA-256
`97646e5b3979b021a04f7b696745a2f09805f5ba192013132d29d0446240704d`.
Its 67 sampled GPU power observations range from 4.2 to 59.63 W, median
11.84 W; host-wide CPU endpoint busy fraction excluding idle and iowait is
0.06728. These describe the sequential export/census/smoke/check observation,
including startup and waits, and do not establish GPU saturation or efficiency.
The original campaign profile and cold-start follow-up remain
[Tessera #364](https://github.com/RobTand/tessera/issues/364).

The successful CAS receipt is
`0470d6d7deae7366f806e1011ba46e7a06f240cc08532c274877543ebfe635ef`.
Its actual 119-byte payload was read and independently rehashed to
`2dc64b2bd1694fe9b42e7f11f20e13e1651e8f0e57eb8afa8d2a30d0bd07946f`;
it records observed output and safe cleanup. The full terminal remains under
`pq183-evidence/` with the action key as filename. Its Git publication copy
redacts PB scope tokens before staging; the publication roster retains both
original and public byte hashes.

The accessible retained deliverable is
`/mnt/shared/tessera-measurements/prismaquant-183-2026-09-05/run183-09/`.
It contains the exported checkpoint, 96 cached wire blobs, original and augmented
manifests, plan/provenance, raw census and paired-smoke records, serving build
identities, logs and both-host telemetry. All 159 copied files were independently
size/hash checked, including the full 16-GB checkpoint; the adjacent
`run183-09-archive-roster.json` records them. Compiled `ext/`, `triton/` and
`vllm-cache/` directories were excluded from this copy and remain in the original
remote output. Original attempts and immutable inputs remain archived.

The bounded, reviewable Git evidence is indexed by
[publication-roster.json](artifacts/pq183-lfm-bound-2026-09-05/publication-roster.json),
including full 96-unit wire audit, population recipe, routing histogram,
attested census, both served build identities, paired smoke, terminal/CAS,
source/artifact seals and telemetry summary. Binary caches and checkpoint
weights remain outside Git. Earlier negative attempts retain their actual
failure disposition; no successful CAS is claimed for them.

The ordinary PrismaQuant pipeline still uses the dense-only translator. This
experiment's producer-owned plan bridge is bounded to the validated selected
stack; general producer/reader integration remains
[Tessera #363](https://github.com/RobTand/tessera/issues/363). The separate Tessera
owner handles upstream repairs without changing this measurement's ba582d47
pin. No further numerical run is required to support this bounded observation.


## Final delivery review

The root review checked all 32 publication files against their archived originals,
including permitted token redactions, and read/hash-checked all 96 fused containers
from the accessible final checkpoint against the wire-audit receipt. It also
verified the actual CAS payload, canonical receipt digest, all six zero-exit
phases, five safe container dispositions, final census/manifest/plan hashes,
post-serve artifact seal and both-host telemetry status. This is an independent
receipt and artifact review, without repeating the numerical campaign.

The initial PR 250 broad CPU CI run is not green: two existing E4M3 rendering
integration cases exceeded the 300-second limit, with 5,630 passes, 152 skips,
3 xfails and 182 passing subtests. The import-surface check passed. Neither
failing test nor its rendering implementation is changed by this PR. Actual
stacks and workload are retained in
[PrismaQuant #251](https://github.com/RobTand/prismaquant/issues/251); their cause
has not been established by an isolated reproduction. This is separate from the
24 passing targeted continuation/finalization regressions and the completed
actual GPU observation.
