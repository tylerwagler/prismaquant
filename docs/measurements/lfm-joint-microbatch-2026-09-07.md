# Streamed joint AURA microbatch qualification, 2026-09-07

The opt-in streamed microbatch implementation in #318 is qualified against
small mathematical fixtures and the actual LFM full-vocabulary source on the
first three canonical calibration sequences. **The full 512-sequence cost run
has not yet executed.** It awaits the independently qualified shared activation
QDQ correction, so a full-cost artifact will price that policy once. These
controls change no production format, runtime pin, default or serving gate.

`probe_microbatch > 0` uses `prismaquant.kl_fisher.global_row.v1`: every global
sequence row has a fixed seed domain and the complete draw's token normalizer.
Local weight, activation and mixed residuals sum while signed across every
partition before squaring, separately for each source Linear. Diagnostics sum
FP32 gradients before taking their norm. GPU logits/recompute graphs are bounded
by batch size; the existing CPU boundaries and probe cotangents still cover the
full draw. The existing source/cache prefetch mechanism remains in use.

The RNG descriptor is independent of partition size. The complete probe identity
also describes source arithmetic: its existing `arithmetic` field now seals the
execution partition. Existing row, paired-candidate and assignment consumers
therefore reject mixed batch sizes, as does checkpoint resume. Legacy zero
retains the original streamed draws; it is not the positive full-size reference.

## Actual source and arithmetic controls

All GPU controls used the known-good image
`eugr/spark-vllm@sha256:0afec8d4f79f44685a1ddf758659d33aef3b0f3ec9068e5a7cd1108d30e5581c`,
Torch `2.13.0+cu130`, Transformers `5.16.1`, BF16 source weights, explicit eager
attention and the original grouped expert backend. Probes are Rademacher,
seeds 7000–7003, all tokens, temperature 1, global normalization. The original
checkpoint, resolved backend, full token artifact, actual subset tensor and
original rendered PWC bytes are sealed in the retained records. The canonical
full token artifact is int64 `[512,512]`, SHA256
`a38312e3b1eeecc2a4363d2a91739ba535388036d4910bffa815d451dcb9a940`.

The fixed-logit CUDA control `9410e1f58090a45151114d7c5b3012bd8be56f798b72a35a811813173fc8ef92`
passed all eight seed/partition comparisons exactly at `[3,512,128000]`:
batch sizes 1 and uneven 2 match size 3 bit for bit. It completed with exit 0,
aggregate reservation 16 GiB and GPU cap 14 GiB. This isolates Fisher probe
construction from model arithmetic.

The resident/streamed control
`2361a4cac58abbafbf18aec3c87365aca12117d95fd092bc0dc919c8cd3e0040`
completed with exit 0 on Sparky, aggregate reservation 64 GiB and GPU cap 48 GiB.
It compares the streamed path to ordinary resident HF execution at each
**same** batch size, using the same three canonical rows and four probes.
Every comparison below is dtype-identical and bit-exact:

| Batch rows | Decoder boundaries | Layer-2 route tensors | Full-vocabulary logits | Packed leaf gradients |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | 24 | 3 | 1 | 8 |
| 1 | 72 | 9 | 3 | 24 |

The two physical leaves are `gate_up_proj [32,3584,2048]` and
`down_proj [32,2048,1792]`. Route tensors are the original packed expert inputs,
expert IDs and route weights. Each gradient comparison records both hashes,
probe and global row offset. The qualification record is
`source-control02/results.json`, SHA256
`5acc61c565159e5e02e7480149d358ccb87eb55bd21ab2b8baa4ced352bb27ce`.

**Negative result: resident batch sizes 3 and 1 are not numerically equivalent.**
Decoder layers 0 and 1 match exactly. Layer 2 first differs by at most
0.00048828125 (relative L2 0.0009286), even though that layer's routed inputs,
IDs and weights match exactly. Subsequent layers amplify the difference:
full-vocabulary logits differ by relative L2 0.0758231 and maximum 9.25;
packed gradients differ by relative L2 0.4334–0.4514. The first difference is
inside the unchanged resident layer, not in streaming or probe RNG. This
control attributes the drift to batch-shaped source arithmetic without claiming
a particular low-level kernel instruction caused it. Canonical census/capture
forwards complete `[1,512]` sequences individually; batch size 1 matches that
arithmetic. CPU partition invariance alone would have missed this distinction.

## Three-row cost and memory controls

Before adding the final arithmetic compatibility seal, original rendered wires
were priced for the existing 96 w1/w3/w2 source Linears of layer 2, with
`TESSERA_E4M3_K1_R1024` and BF16. These are bounded diagnostic artifacts, not
full-calibration or native-panel costs. Their shared RNG identity permitted the
cross-size comparison that exposed the source arithmetic difference; final
consumers now refuse that mixed execution.

| PB action | Batch rows | Largest tail | Peak PyTorch GPU allocation |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| `ada12c11bda42cc6106d4d32a363176024304b1e40aeec1bab2cd80d44fc9a80` | 3 | `[3,512,128000]` | 23,714,409,472 bytes |
| `7bbddb3785e70ea6ed9f39418752d0fe3888679f9385e125fdc8d8631f33a18d` | 1 | `[1,512,128000]` | 20,415,026,688 bytes |

Both completed with exit 0 on Sparky under 40 GiB aggregate reservations and
32 GiB GPU caps. Each captured 157,286,400 bytes of host decoder boundaries.
The size-1 path made 12 bounded tail calls; size 3 made four. These measurements
establish bounded tail allocation on actual packed/full-vocabulary geometry.
They are not total physical-memory peaks and are not throughput claims.
Both arms retain CPU/CUDA `torch.profiler` memory/operator traces and both
hosts' Netdata series. Trace export overhead is included in the recorded
profile phase; those durations are not an isolated speed comparison.

The signed per-probe costs differ by normalized L2 0.42472 across batch sizes.
Summing the 96 unary predictions gives 0.0030473746 versus 0.0028390700; neither
sum is measured KL or a coherent whole-block quadratic. The same-size resident
controls above explain why these differences cannot be dismissed as a probe
partition bug, nor treated as comparable finite source arithmetic.

The first size-3 control's derived subset header retained its parent's sampling
counts. Its recorded actual `[3,512]` tensor digest and independently hashed
parent artifact establish the diagnostic input. That subset is not a native
panel input. The harness now adjusts subset counts and int32 draw identity;
size-1 and subsequent derived artifacts use the corrected header.

## Regression and retained evidence

Final targeted CPU validation
`fa5598de04a8f35cefa873b7e8bbd1845982f6b9517a831be0a57f00e4cf80db`
passed **121 tests, no skips**, through PB with four workers/native threads 1
and an 8 GiB aggregate reservation. It covers Fisher all/last/causal scopes,
uneven partitions, an independent packed row oracle with nonzero cross terms,
gradient diagnostics, checkpoint refusal, actual paired/assignment consumers,
legacy streamed/packed behavior and architecture/calibration documentation.
The initial missing-API regression `8bae3225...` failed five tests as expected;
`8549364a...` demonstrated that three existing consumers accepted mixed execution
sizes before the arithmetic seal. Earlier green checks are retained rather
than substituted for the final snapshot.

The first CUDA probe control `1cf4d668...` wrote eight exact comparisons but
ended with exit 137: PB stopped it after GPU-reported use 10,834,935,808 bytes
exceeded its 10,737,418,240-byte cap for two samples. Host OOM counts were zero
and cleanup completed. Its output is partial evidence, superseded by the
successful correctly reserved retry. Source control `25fefb27...` failed before
loading because its `device_map` required absent `accelerate`; it was corrected
to the already proven `from_pretrained(...).cuda()` load path. One intermediate
submission refused a changing checkout before any action executed. None of
these failures is reported as a pass.

[The manifest](lfm-joint-microbatch-2026-09-07.json) hashes the retained outputs,
exact PB requests, sanitized terminal summaries, logs, independently rehashed
CAS payloads/receipts and harnesses under
`/mnt/shared/tessera-measurements/pq318-joint-microbatch-20260907`.
Each PB checkout snapshot seals the historical code used by that action;
retained latest harnesses are convenient entry points, not replacements for
those snapshot identities. Full 512-row validation and final qualified-QDQ
cost production remain explicitly pending.


## Qualified activation QDQ and regenerated operator screen

The subsequent shared activation-QDQ fix preserves native FP32 tensor division
by 448 and signed zero in the fallback cast. The native parity diagnostic
`native-qdq-qualification/diagnostic-after-01.json`, SHA256
`e955dfe266e5f704e38624549d9543019f2d8eec049fcd34ceed3e73ddbefeb6`,
compares all 512 retained row scales and 1,048,576 activation codes: scales,
codes and reconstructed prefill/decode tensors are bit-exact. PB actions
`e9b8fe8567c646308c86bb3628764e3030608e35b35065bc6f6ef8b7337f15cb`
(four CPU/CUDA regression parameters) and
`d1c9f2ba1b7934161fddc88319a81bebe3094e8861e03193f9c5ae23cbd39e4b`
(actual native parity) both completed with exit 0 and verified cleanup/CAS.

The original row-0 operator screen was regenerated using that qualified QDQ,
original PWC bytes, original four legacy probes and the same 96 logical members.
PB `43b4b43e7a623cd97a0c024d0ac411572475ba26dab18558a58160e33547910d`
completed with exit 0 on Sparklina. `cost03-native-qdq/joint-cost.json` has SHA256
`66306b6f5feaecfbf5569a43c596b4229bf133ca036bc016fd2634a113780c39`;
it contains 192 candidate rows. Its producer digest is
`41f67d31422d3b41605cd5587a5d3432e2b38e1f4a0868c5694e6891cece679f`.
This supersedes cost02 for the native operator panel after the QDQ correction;
it remains an operator-subset screen, not a full-calibration cost. Peak PyTorch
GPU allocation was 19,243,265,024 bytes under a 40 GiB aggregate reservation and
32 GiB GPU cap. Both hosts' Netdata series are retained with the result.

The combined integration action
`f743a8375609bfb12586000e9e8bd1ea36096410a22bdebf73856204b5935cb9`
passed 122 tests in 19.45 seconds with four workers/native threads 1, no skips,
and an 8 GiB reservation. The CPU-only `-k 'not cuda'` selection deselected two
CUDA parameters (covered by the QDQ action above) and one existing CPU test
whose name contains `cuda` (already passed in the previous 121-test run).

An off-task PrismaBuild capability gap was filed as
[PrismaBuild #340](https://github.com/RobTand/prismabuild/issues/340): campaign
value parsing cannot express a GPU-memory cap separately from aggregate memory.
The full and operator-screen actions were submitted as independent ordinary PB
quanta with explicit caps. PrismaBuild retained placement and admission ownership.


## Full canonical calibration completed

The pending full draw subsequently completed under the qualified activation
policy. PB action
`38ec1f47fee64d8f33c38f3644d2ea432355fc76130809f2ffc27487740ff19b`
finished on Sparky with exit 0, empty stderr, complete resource cleanup and no
OOM events. Its independently rehashed CAS payload is
`9474451605ce6ab7a6e672ebcc9f90e446494552c5cf3f72f897bfadbff59e0f`;
the receipt digest is
`d3b11de544a27c80dd49bc6705e3d0a2e485a948b16b02afc60d3cec658cbd9c`.

`full512-batch1/joint-cost.json`, SHA256
`5e94df0523a161e40931b4610c14b8b6667abd05057d4df58c1e3392091d20d8`,
prices the same 96 layer-2 w1/w3/w2 members and original PWC bytes using all
512 canonical sequences, with four probes and 512 complete-sequence partitions.
There are 192 candidate rows. Every signed vector is finite, has seeds
7000–7003, and reproduces its stored unary prediction by half the mean square;
all BF16 candidate costs are zero. The 96 quantized unary predictions sum to
0.0037147759697539395. This sum is a sum of per-Linear predictions, not measured
KL or a coherent whole-block quadratic. This full-draw artifact is distinct
from the row-0 operator-panel screen above.

Its global-row noise identity binds `[512,512]`, vocabulary 128000 and global
token count 262144. The arithmetic identity binds batch size 1 and 512
partitions. The producer digest remains
`41f67d31422d3b41605cd5587a5d3432e2b38e1f4a0868c5694e6891cece679f`.
The full canonical safetensors artifact itself is supplied as the subset input,
so its original metadata/path and SHA remain unchanged. The checkpoint manifest
and all 96 completed unit shards are retained and hashed alongside the cost.
This run establishes completed checkpoint production; it did not repeat the
full job to demonstrate resume, whose refusal/recovery behavior is covered by
the targeted regression suite.

The full run captured 26,843,545,600 bytes of CPU decoder boundaries. It made
2048 tail calls, all with logits shape `[1,512,128000]`. Peak PyTorch GPU
allocation was **20,751,726,080 bytes** and peak reserved GPU memory was
23,603,445,760 bytes. PB reported a separate cgroup memory peak of
38,643,929,088 bytes under the 80 GiB aggregate reservation and 32 GiB GPU cap.
These counters describe different memory views and are not added together or
presented as the system's total physical-memory peak. Host boundaries and probe
cotangents grow with the full draw; the existing resident GPU source cache is
already included in PyTorch's allocation count.

The PB wrapper elapsed 963.23 seconds; the harness marked this as a correctness
phase without an in-process profile. Both hosts' raw Netdata series are retained.
This is completion and allocation evidence, not a speedup or bottleneck claim;
the earlier paired three-row controls carry the in-process memory profiles.
The final manifest now hashes **226 artifacts totaling 1,002,043,668 bytes**,
including full results, checkpoint shards, both-host telemetry, exact action
requests, terminal logs and verified CAS receipts. No full-calibration task
remains pending for this 96-member qualification, and no default or serving
gate changes as a consequence of it.
