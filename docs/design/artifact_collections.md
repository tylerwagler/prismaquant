# Artifact collections: probe once, solve and export many

Status: **CURRENT foundation, not pipeline-wired** (branch
`codex/rtx5060-fp4-gridbook-pilot-20260824`, based on `55602f9`).  The live
implementation is `prismaquant/artifact_collection.py`; the read-only bridge
for existing exports is `prismaquant/artifact_collection_legacy.py`.  This
foundation changes no format menu, allocator default, export codec, runtime
contract, or ship gate.

## 1. Purpose

An expensive model probe should be reusable across any number of candidate
sets, byte targets, device profiles, solves, exports, and qualifications.  A
new artifact size should begin at solve; a newly implemented format should
begin at cost if the existing probe already contains its declared features.
Neither event should silently trigger a new probe.

The control plane therefore separates four things that legacy handoffs often
mix together:

1. scientific identity (what was measured or chosen);
2. physical content identity (the exact bytes carrying it);
3. location (where those bytes happen to be mounted or published); and
4. evidence (an immutable receipt that an operation occurred).

The first implementation slice deliberately stops before pipeline wiring.  It
provides strict, content-addressed records, candidate and target schemas,
stage receipts, collection manifests, exact shared-resource accounting, and a
legacy artifact census.

## 2. Record topology

```text
model snapshot ──┐
probe campaign ──┼── collection contract ── target A ── solve/export/qualify receipts
candidate catalog┤                         ├─ target B ── solve/export/qualify receipts
cost snapshot ───┘                         └─ target N ── solve/export/qualify receipts
                                                   │
                                      regenerable collection manifest
```

The model, probe, catalog, and cost objects are common references.  Variants
contain a target profile and export contract under one common accounting rule.
Every receipt binds the exact collection contract and either the common
measurement campaign or one declared variant; accepted receipts require an
output, and all receipts require inputs and evidence.  Stage completion can
therefore be derived by a future DAG evaluator rather than written into a
mutable `status` field (`make_stage_receipt`, `make_collection_manifest`).

The v1 foundation defines these semantic records:

| Record | Identity-bearing responsibility |
|---|---|
| candidate | Complete numerical, basis, render, scale, activation, container, and runtime semantics |
| candidate catalog | Explicit set of candidate references; gaps and cross-family overlaps are legal |
| target profile | Exact artifact-byte ceiling, usable VRAM, accounting rule, device/workload references, placement, exclusions |
| collection contract | One common measurement base plus a sorted set of named target variants |
| stage receipt | Immutable accepted/rejected evidence for measure, solve, validate, export, qualify, or publish |
| collection manifest | Regenerable index of one contract and its receipt set |
| legacy export audit | Separate assignment, physical-tensor, recorded-byte, and observed-byte censuses |

ModelSnapshot, ProbeCampaign, CostSnapshot, Assignment, Export, and Device
Qualification remain referenced opaque records in this slice.  Their strict
payload validators are the next control-plane layer; their references already
bind schema, semantic ID, content SHA-256, and byte size, so they can be added
without changing collection identity rules.

### 2.1 Complete planned DAG payloads

The opaque v1 references are not unspecified.  Their future typed payloads
have the following minimum identities and reconciliation rules:

| Entity | Required identity | Required reconciliation |
|---|---|---|
| ModelSnapshot | portable source binding; model-profile contract; immutable unit-ledger blob; assignment-required and excluded unit-set digests; producer source-tree digest | unit IDs/qnames unique; required and excluded sets disjoint and exhaustive; shapes and parameter totals reconcile to checkpoint headers |
| ProbeCampaign | ModelSnapshot ref; exact probe blob; calibration/token-content identity; measured feature set; covered/missing unit sets; merge receipt; producer | covered units resolve in ModelSnapshot; missing required units explicit; candidate reuse requires `required_probe_features` to be a subset of measured features |
| CostSnapshot | model/probe/catalog refs; observation blob; named metric contracts; cell coverage; measured/derived/unavailable counts; accounting-rule ref; producer | every cell resolves to an applicable unit/candidate pair; values finite under one currency; derived cells retain anchors; candidate-local bytes never masquerade as whole-artifact bytes |
| Assignment/Solve | model/probe/catalog/cost/target refs; exact unit→candidate records; optimized/fixed partitions; solver/search-space identity; predicted metrics; exact byte breakdown | every required unit assigned once; fixed and optimized sets disjoint/exhaustive; optimized choices have cost cells; all choices are applicable; accounting rule and target ceiling agree |
| Export | Solve ref; assignment digest; producer; exact file/tensor/codebook inventory; runtime artifact identity; named byte measurements | assignment agrees with Solve; inventories have no missing or extra members; content hashes verify; Target is checked against its exact named byte scope |
| DeviceQualification | Export and Target refs; runtime-contract ref; exact device/workload/placement; required check IDs; immutable evidence blobs; verdict | every check binds the same artifact; required set exact; device and placement satisfy Target; evidence from one device class cannot qualify another |
| MarketSnapshot | source-content refs for survey observations; observation date; normalized device IDs; counts/shares plus scope and collection method | raw observations remain separate by source; Hugging Face users are not presented as installed-base counts; Steam shares are not converted into absolute units |
| ReleaseDecision | MarketSnapshot ref; candidate Target/Export/Qualification refs; policy identity; included and rejected variants with reasons | no unqualified artifact is included; artifact aliases remain outside scientific identity; one release decision cannot mutate upstream evidence |

The release view is therefore a traversal over immutable records, not a ninth
mutable mega-manifest.  A target can be added by producing Target and Solve
records against the same shared probe/cost base.  A candidate can be added at
CostSnapshot only if the existing ProbeCampaign proves feature sufficiency;
otherwise it correctly starts a new probe lineage.

## 3. Identity and publication rules

Every record uses the repository's canonical JSON implementation
(`cost_stage_checkpoint.canonical_json`) and the envelope:

```json
{
  "schema": "prismaquant.artifact_collection.candidate.v1",
  "payload": {},
  "payload_sha256": "64 lowercase hexadecimal characters",
  "locators": {
    "subject payload SHA-256": ["advisory location"]
  }
}
```

`payload_sha256` is the semantic ID.  `locators` is an optional, sorted,
in-memory resolution overlay excluded from that ID.  `write_record` publishes
only the portable three-field semantic envelope, so the resulting file's
SHA-256 and size exactly match `reference_for_record`; locator overlays must be
distributed separately.  Moving identical content between a local worktree,
object store, and Hugging Face cannot rename it.  References contain the
subject schema and semantic ID plus the SHA-256 and size of its portable
content.  One `(subject schema, semantic ID)` is forbidden from resolving to
multiple contents.  Timestamps, aliases, release labels, and mutable gates do
not enter scientific identities.

All recognized payloads and the envelope itself are closed objects: unknown
identity-bearing fields fail validation.  JSON duplicate keys, non-finite
numbers, malformed hashes, Boolean-as-integer byte counts, tampering, and
duplicate references also fail.  `write_record` publishes via a no-clobber
hard-link operation; it will not replace a file or symlink that already
exists.

## 4. Candidates, including learned versus lattice bases

A format name is presentation, not candidate identity.  The candidate record
binds:

- format semantics and parameters (family and rung are data, not schema
  enums);
- basis kind, scope, and exact asset references;
- renderer, scale, and activation contracts;
- serialization and runtime contracts;
- required probe and runtime feature sets;
- applicability rules; and
- shared physical resources.

Consequently `NVFP4_CB_K12` backed by a lattice and the same label backed by a
learned book are distinct candidates.  Two containers for the same numerical
candidate are also distinct candidates, but share the computed `behavior_id`;
validation can therefore be reused without pretending the exported bytes are
the same.  Lattice assets are content-bound just like learned assets—"fixed"
does not mean provenance-free.

The schema encodes no intrinsic minimum, maximum, or contiguous rung range.
K1, a future research K32, holes between them, and overlaps with FP8 are all
representable as explicit catalog members. That data-model capability is not
format authority. The current public NVFP4 format catalog is exactly K1–K25;
K26–K32 have no parser, registry, contract, chooser, assignment, bundle, or
export identity. Promotion policy remains external: lattice-first is the safe
production default, while a learned candidate must earn its extra asset,
training, and runtime complexity under the same target and qualification
contract. Learned NVFP4 remains receipt-gated and refused today.

The same separation applies to W8A16/source FP8. The generic schema may census
or reference a compatibility candidate for an already-published source-model
artifact without making it a maintained candidate for a new target. The
Qwen3.8 SM120/RTX50 collection is BF16-sourced and its exact serving profile
explicitly denies `W8A16_COMPAT_FORMAT_NAMES`; its catalog-to-assignment and
materialization steps must therefore intersect both source applicability and
that profile before recording an accepted Solve/Export/ReleaseDecision. The
current resident and streaming CB materializers already enforce the assignment
half when `layer_config.json` carries its allocator-stamped `target_profile`:
they refuse a denied format before opening an output transaction. Target v1 is
not pipeline-wired and does not yet perform the catalog intersection itself, so
free-form `exclusions` are not format authority and no collection record may
claim the earlier gate has run without its own receipt. Legacy readers remain
broad; maintained performance eligibility is target-specific and fail-closed.

The range study retains a **direct-codec/kernel research span through K32** but
recommends a public artifact catalog of **K1–K25**. With two four-value-vector
product subtables, the index split is `(ceil(K/2), floor(K/2))`; K1 is therefore
the valid `(1, 0)` degenerate product, not malformed metadata. An E2M1 value
has 15 distinct numeric possibilities (the two signed-zero encodings compare
equal), so a four-value tuple has `15^4 = 50,625` distinct numeric vectors. A
width-16 table can therefore fill 65,536 physical rows only by deterministic
duplicate fill. K32 is still useful for a low-level uint32 packing boundary
test, not as a shippable format.

The sidecar grows much earlier.  An FP16 sidecar product dictionary occupies
`2 * (4*2^ceil(K/2) + 4*2^floor(K/2))` bytes: 65,536 at K24, 98,304 at K25,
and 131,072 at K26. The present GB10 full-dictionary staging budget is 101,376
bytes (`gridbook/csrc/cb_gemv_v2.cu`), making K25 the last rung compatible with
that whole-dictionary staging architecture. Gridbook's generic global-LUT
kernel can structurally exercise larger direct-codec words, but the accepted
performance cutoff is K25 and there is no legacy artifact reason to preserve
K26–K32 as public wire ids. The external v11 contract must therefore declare
both NVFP4 `rungs` and `producer_rungs` as K1–K25, and every eligibility cell
must be a subset. Its current sm120 evidence is only `compile_only`: dense and
routed decode are `backed`; routed batch is `backed` only for
`role_split=false` through persistent-B, with a generic expand-to-BF16
`fallback`; dense batch is likewise only the expand-to-BF16 `fallback`.
Accordingly:

- enumerate and export K1–K25 as explicit artifact candidates;
- keep K26–K32 confined to direct-codec, lattice-asset, and kernel research
  tests with no public format spelling;
- advertise every new band only as validation-only while its exact target,
  structure, regime, rung, and predicate winner remains `compile_only` or
  `fallback`;
- promote no rung to a shipping chooser until both decode and batch have exact
  `device_qualified` backed winners and physical parity/speed gates pass; and
- keep lattice and learned versions conceptually distinct at every public rung,
  with lattice the baseline and learned promotion driven by measured artifact
  quality after its shared asset cost is charged exactly once; the current
  NVFP4 producer refuses learned bases until that receipt exists.

## 5. Byte accounting

An assignment maps a unit ID to a candidate ID and declares local bytes plus
shared-resource claims.  `assignment_byte_breakdown` sums local bytes and
deduplicates shared resources by physical content SHA-256.  It rejects a
reused digest with inconsistent sizes and duplicate unit IDs.

This primitive is intentionally smaller than the final whole-artifact
accountant.  The same `accounting_rule` reference must flow from target to
solve to export, where the implementation must add fixed model data,
container overhead, tokenizer/config files, and packaging files under one
named scope.  Candidate-local byte estimates must never substitute for the
final recursive package measurement.

### 5.1 Hardware tiers and export shoulders

As observed 2026-08-24, NVIDIA's desktop specifications group the relevant
cards into 8 GB (RTX 5050/5060 and one 5060 Ti SKU), 12 GB (5070), 16 GB
(the other 5060 Ti SKU, 5070 Ti, and 5080), and 32 GB (5090). Laptop parts are
predominantly 8 GB through 5070, 12 GB at 5070 Ti, 16 GB at 5080, and 24 GB at
5090. Sources:
[NVIDIA desktop comparison](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/compare/)
and [NVIDIA laptop comparison](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/laptops/50-series/).

Two demand proxies point at different but complementary audiences. The live
[Hugging Face hardware page](https://huggingface.co/hardware) gave the following
per-SKU owner incidences; its
[methodology](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/hardware) makes this opt-in,
self-reported public-profile telemetry rather than unique people, sales, or a
population estimate:

| reported SKU | VRAM variants | HF incidences |
|---|---:|---:|
| RTX 5050 desktop / laptop | 8 GB / 8 GB | 255 / 237 |
| RTX 5060 desktop / laptop | 8 GB / 8 GB | 3,625 / 1,010 |
| RTX 5060 Ti desktop | 8 or 16 GB | 13,470 |
| RTX 5070 desktop / laptop | 12 GB / 8 or 12 GB | 6,104 / 1,260 |
| RTX 5070 Ti desktop / laptop | 16 GB / 12 GB | 13,530 / 964 |
| RTX 5080 desktop / laptop | 16 GB / 16 GB | 9,264 / 1,046 |
| RTX 5090 desktop / laptop | 32 GB / 24 GB | 16,538 / 994 |
| RTX 5090 D desktop | 32 GB | 498 |

Those rows total 68,795 incidences, 20.78% of the 331,048 summed NVIDIA-SKU
incidences on the page. They are not a unique-user denominator. Valve's July
2026 displayed RTX 50 rows instead sum to 16.60% of surveyed video cards. The
[Steam survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=name)
is optional and anonymous, publishes no respondent count, and combines such
capacity variants as the 8/16 GB 5060 Ti. Allocating ambiguous identifiers to
either possible capacity gives the following honest ranges:

| capacity | HF share of RTX 50 incidences | Steam share of all displayed cards |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 GB | 7.5–28.9% | 5.79–8.77% |
| 12 GB | 10.3–12.1% | 3.99–4.57% |
| 16 GB | 34.7–54.2% | 3.41–5.81% |
| 24 GB | 1.4% | not separately listed |
| 32 GB | 24.8% | 0.43% |

These are a dated snapshot of mutable pages. A release campaign must store
the source URL, observation time, extraction method, and raw receipt in a
MarketSnapshot rather than silently treating these numbers as a current
installed base.

The solve grid should be dense from 5 through 25 decimal GB because one probe
can feed many cheap solves and exports. Publication should expose a small,
named collection of physically qualified shoulders:

| artifact alias | target tier | whole-package target | publication intent |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `vram-8-stretch` | 8 GiB | 6.0–6.5 GB | Experimental small-context reach build; ship only if full GPU-only residency and eager/graph, KV, KL, PPL, and performance gates pass on real 5050/5060 hardware. Otherwise publish a smaller model, not a nominally fitting 27B. |
| `vram-12-compact` | 12 GiB | at most 10.0 GB | Primary compact 27B build, leaving about 2.7 GiB for runtime, activations, and a modest KV cache after exact resident/cold-load measurement. |
| `vram-16-balanced` | 16 GiB | at most 13.0 GB | Primary broad-reach quality build; the current 12.98 GB oracle is the first regression target, not automatic qualification. |
| `vram-24-quality` | 24 GiB | 19–20 GB | Higher-quality build with materially larger runtime/context headroom than a capacity-filling export. |
| `vram-32-max-quality` | 32 GiB | approximately 23–25 GB | Stop at measured quality saturation rather than filling VRAM for its own sake. |

A 10.0 GB decimal package is 9.31 GiB before runtime allocations, so it cannot
be a fully resident 8-GiB artifact. It is a conditional 12-GiB target and a
comfortable capacity target at 16 GiB or above. Because export is cheap, every
solve shoulder may be materialized, but ReleaseDecision should normally publish
at most one headroom and one quality artifact per tier based on physical
qualification and measured quality—not on a round marketing size. The 8-GiB
tier is the reach objective; 12 and 16 GiB are the credible initial shipping
tiers for a 27B model.

## 6. Legacy Qwen3.8-27B regression oracle

The current 13 GB Qwen artifact proves why named scopes are necessary.  The
legacy importer reads `quant_config.json` for assignment and recorded export
authority, a safetensors-header `shapes.json` projection for physical tensor
authority, and optionally stats the current artifact directory.  It does not
hash the 13 GB model and labels the directory observation
`stat_size_only_unsealed`.

The 2026-08-24 census is:

| Scope | Value |
|---|---:|
| explicit format assignments | 498 = 496 CB + 2 auxiliary |
| format assignments plus otherwise-fixed MTP matrix modules | 506 |
| physical model tensors | 1,365 |
| physical `mtp.` tensors | 15 = 8 matrices + 7 support tensors |
| physical `mtp.` bytes | 849,398,784 |
| CB tensor payload | 10,116,354,728 |
| shared CB sidecars | 103,424 |
| serialized CB body | 10,116,458,152 |
| producer-recorded recursive export | 12,982,409,320 |
| currently observed recursive package | 12,982,463,529 |
| post-inventory drift | 54,209 |

The drift is exactly `README.md` (18,796), `allocation-map.png` (14,624), and
`serve_manifest.json` (20,789).  The importer preserves both totals; it does
not overwrite producer provenance with a later observation.  Its recorded
ledger balances exactly as:

```text
12,982,409,320
  = 10,116,458,152 serialized CB body
  +    849,398,784 physical MTP namespace
  +  2,016,552,384 fixed recorded residual
```

This oracle also forbids an ambiguous `unit_count`: assignment units,
CB-only targets, matrix modules, and physical tensors are separately named.

## 7. Next implementation layers

The foundation is ready for the following work without deciding the NVFP4
rung range:

1. strict ModelSnapshot and UnitLedger payloads derived from `model_walk`;
2. a ProbeCampaign adapter that publishes feature coverage and a portable
   source binding;
3. a CostSnapshot adapter with measured/derived/unavailable cell provenance;
4. an Assignment/Solve record that maps every required unit to a candidate
   ID and invokes one whole-artifact accounting rule;
5. Export and DeviceQualification records that bind exact file hashes,
   artifact identity, runtime contract, workload, placement, and hardware;
6. a release-policy evaluator that derives publishability by traversing
   accepted receipts; and
7. only then, catalog population for the desired NVFP4 lattice and learned
   candidates and physical qualification on the target RTX 50-series tiers.

Until those adapters land, these records are an offline control-plane API,
not a claim that any new rung, artifact size, or device route is supported.
