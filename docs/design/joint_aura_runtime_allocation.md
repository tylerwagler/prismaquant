# Joint AURA and runtime-constrained allocation

Status: research, opt-in. Tracked by PrismaQuant #237. This extends the
streamed AURA producer, production weight cache, allocator candidate builders,
and existing serving-constraint controls. It does not change the default
format menu, Tessera runtime pin, or serving admission.

The [full-domain Tessera quality–prefill experiment specification](tessera_quality_prefill_experiment.md)
defines the proposed multi-unit transfer validation, matched runtime producer,
full-model coverage expansion and empirical confirmation program. It is a
handoff for implementation; the contracts and measured readiness below remain
unchanged. Its optional runtime-v2 dependency does not block direct measured
comparisons of independently configured complete artifacts.

## Measurement and objective

For one Linear, a route changes both its input and its rendered weight.
With `dX = Xhat - X` and `dW = What - W`, the complete local perturbation is

```
dY = X dW.T + dX W.T + dX dW.T
a[k] = <G_Y[k], dY>
cost = 0.5 mean_k(a[k] ** 2)
```

The streamed producer's `joint_activation=True` mode (CLI
`--joint-activation`) projects these terms through its downstream KL
cotangents. Terms and repeated invocations of the same Linear are summed
while signed, before squaring. The existing production cache supplies actual
rendered tensors. The shared activation QDQ owner supplies the route's
activation behavior, including calibrated static scales. The lease owns no
additional activation or weight cache. Resident FP32 projection products
reuse one activation-perturbation GEMM across matching activation policies.

Joint rows retain their signed components, aligned probe samples, source and
render tensor identities, activation policy/scales, projection arithmetic,
calibration and probe identities. A joint price already includes its
downstream Fisher and activation error; scalar sensitivity, calibrated gains
and AQUA activation transfer must not be applied again. Joint and weight-only
or output-MSE rows cannot share a joint allocation table. BF16 controls carry
complete measured zero rows rather than an unobserved zero placeholder.

Joint rows require at least two probes; one draw cannot estimate sampling
variance. Common probes enable paired differences. Their conditional sampling error is
not uncertainty over new calibration data or evidence of generalization.
The additive sum of local quadratic prices is still a model approximation;
it does not establish the quality of every joint assignment.

### Packed source projections

`--include-routed-experts` with streamed joint AURA also accepts the existing
profile-declared `PackedExpertProjection` views. A packed source is observed
through its actual per-expert `F.linear` slices or `F.grouped_mm` packed
transposes and cumulative expert row offsets. Its model, expert backend, routing
and source arithmetic remain intact. Fused gate/up output gradients are split using those
exact views. Source views refresh at each streaming install and unload, and a
single hook on each packed leaf serves its logical members. An implementation
that bypasses the declared Linear boundaries refuses instead of emitting an
unobserved zero price. A genuinely unrouted member still receives aligned zero
samples.

The LFM packed block produces 96 source-Linear rows (32 experts times w1/w3/w2),
with each member's actual rendered weight and activation policy. These require
original decoded production-cache entries; the on-demand dense renderer is not
an adapter for packed sources and refuses early. All repeated uses of the SAME
logical Linear sum while signed before squaring. Different members remain
separate unary prices under the existing additive objective. A whole-block
runtime measurement binds the complete roster without inventing a group quality
price; the explicitly requested diagnostics below remain available.

## Assignment diagnostics

`joint_aura.assignment_probe_summary` and `paired_assignment_difference`
consume complete joint rows keyed by unit. The paired helper requires the
same nonempty unit roster in both arms, including unchanged units. Every row
must pass the producer's identity and sample validator. Probe IDs and the full
probe identity (source model, calibration, producer source and arithmetic)
must agree. Each unit retains its source weight; different formats carry
their own validated render and activation identities. The same unit/format
cannot silently change operator binding between arms.

The explicit `objective` determines the per-probe quantity:

- `additive` (default): `0.5 sum_i(a_i[k] ** 2)`, the allocator's unary sum.
- `joint_quadratic`: `0.5 (sum_i a_i[k]) ** 2`, the baseline local
  linearization with cross-unit terms retained.

Pairing reports A minus B on common samples and its empirical standard error,
conditional on the fixed calibration. Unchanged units cancel from additive
differences, but remain in the cross terms of `joint_quadratic`. Neither
objective measures a new background forward pass or fixes background-dependent
unary ordering. There is no automatic allocator refinement or admission from
these diagnostics.

The existing `aura_additivity_gate` CLI accepts `--comparison-assignment` and
`--paired-objective` to append this paired report. Its additivity prediction
always remains additive. Complete aligned joint rows use
`stderr_method=per_probe_aligned_empirical`. Historical bare arrays retain
their previous numeric estimate as `per_probe_unverified`; equal lengths are
not proof of alignment. Without arrays the independence estimate is labeled
`independence_assumed`, not a covariance lower bound. Old bare-list screen
receipts remain unverified by this identity contract.

Measured KL must be finite; a finite negative sample estimate is allowed.
Its supplied standard error must be finite and nonnegative.
The existing `measured_kl_stderr` is caller-supplied held-out sequence
uncertainty and stays separate from the probe standard error. The residual
z-score is descriptive and assumes independent probe and sequence errors;
this helper does not certify the supplied held-out dataset or estimate
generalization from probe variance.

## Runtime input and search

`--measured-runtime-table` opts the allocator into measured-resource search.
`--measured-runtime-context` supplies the independently expected context. The
existing `--slo-prefill-p95-ttft-ms` sets its prefill proposal budget; optional
decode ITL and device-memory limits remain separate constraints. This mode
does not mix the legacy family-relative dispatch table with exact operator
measurements. A throughput floor cannot be inferred from operator medians.

The versioned table binds the actual cost-payload digest, source/calibration,
GPU and full runtime identity, prompt length, batch, TP, graph/residency mode,
and exact operator routes. `source_sha256` equals the streamed source model
identity's `content_sha256`; `calibration_sha256` equals the joint AURA probe
identity's calibration digest. The CLI compares these against the cost rows.
Every row binds actual joint operator identities,
member formats and shapes. Timings are repeated GPU measurements with raw
receipt hashes; the stored price is their median. Fused-group options need
whole-group timing. Encoder time, activation width and relative speed hints
cannot substitute for this input. No current runtime timing table ships as a
default.

Candidate reduction preserves all legal alternatives before runtime pricing,
including a faster, higher-loss route at the same serialized size. Fused
folding preserves every licensed coherent member recipe under an explicit
combination cap. The new solver enumerates the discrete nondominated
frontier in serialized bytes, quality cost and prefill time, optionally
including decode and device resources. It uses integer bytes, with no
rate-bin rounding or convex-hull assumption. State and transition limits
refuse excess work instead of silently truncating an answer.

Serialized weight bytes, terminal weight residency, peak activation memory,
peak scratch, and fixed KV/non-Linear resources remain separate. The solver
adds residency and tracks activation and scratch maxima independently.
Exactness describes the supplied additive resource model and finite menu.
Variable assignment-shared overhead needs explicit accounting; a final
feasibility filter cannot by itself establish global artifact optimality.

The allocator checks the expanded, promoted assignment and its fixed
auxiliary choices against the same measured resource contract. The sum of
operator medians is a proposal estimate, not an end-to-end p95 TTFT or decode
measurement. Existing serving and publication gates remain authoritative.

## Validation and promotion plan

The baseline is weight-only AURA over exactly the same production renders,
calibration tensors, sequence lengths and common probes. The candidate adds
the complete activation/weight residual. Numerical checks compare the
decomposition against an independently formed local residual, including
cancellation, mixed terms, repeated invocations, static QDQ and the identity
activation case. Cache/checkpoint tests verify resumption and changed-input
refusals. Solver checks compare exhaustive assignment enumeration on
nonconvex, same-byte and multiple-resource examples; CLI checks exercise
actual selection and final expanded-assignment feasibility.

The current-model numerical screen uses Qwen3-0.6B, a fixed unquantized
teacher, shared calibration and separate held-out tokens, and a bounded
measured subset of real Linears. It compares candidate and assignment KL/NLL
without re-centering the teacher. In-process profiles and host telemetry
record the workload and execution cost; outcomes belong in dated measurement
receipts, including negative or inconclusive results.

Production promotion additionally requires real served assignments on the
target runtime, matched-byte uniform controls, end-to-end prefill/decode and
residency measurements, and the existing held-out/downstream gates. The
fixed teacher remains the reference for bounded close swaps. Sparse-anchor
interpolation requires separate joint-currency pilot and held-out evidence;
the existing output-MSE replay and historical Gridbook coefficients do not
qualify this currency. Until those gates pass, this feature remains research.

## Explicit invocation

With an existing matching production cache, probe file and measured format
list, collect the joint table using the normal streamed producer:

```bash
python3 -m prismaquant.aura_cost --model "$MODEL" \
  --streaming --joint-activation --production-cache production.pkl \
  --formats "$MEASURED_FORMATS" --n-probes 16 \
  --checkpoint-dir joint-checkpoints --output joint.pkl

python3 -m prismaquant.allocator --probe probe.pkl --costs joint.pkl \
  --formats "$MEASURED_FORMATS" --target-bits "$TARGET_BITS" \
  --measured-runtime-table runtime.json --measured-runtime-context context.json \
  --slo-prefill-p95-ttft-ms "$PREFILL_BUDGET_MS" \
  --layer-config layer-config.json --pareto-csv pareto.csv
```

`runtime.json` must contain measurements of the exact supplied operator
recipes and workload, including fixed work. The numerical screen does not
produce those serving measurements. Menu eligibility and model-profile
requirements still apply to these direct CLI invocations. The pipeline
wrapper does not infer these experimental inputs or enable this mode.

The [current-model screen](../measurements/pq237-joint-aura-screen-2026-09-05.md)
verifies numerical decomposition but shows no selection-quality gain.
Qualification remains open in #237.

An existing draw can be passed unchanged with `--calibration-input` and its
independently held `--calibration-input-sha256`. The safetensors artifact contains
only `calibration_ids` (int64, samples × sequence length); its
`calibration_provenance` metadata records the original draw, including
`fit_ids_sha256`, `fit_tokens`, `nsamples`, and `seqlen`. The explicit CLI sample
and sequence counts must match. This path bypasses dataset sampling and refuses
`--dataset`. It checks the campaign's int32 token hash and separately records
the int64 token hash used by joint AURA, with the original seed retained in
provenance. A WT2 train 32 × 512 torch-randint draw and the retained diverse
32 × 1024 Fisher draw are different calibrations even when both name seed zero.

The research native bridge in `prismaquant.native_operator_panel` prepares
reference inputs through the existing PWC, shared activation QDQ, and decoded
producer wire. `experiments/pq267_native_panel.py` transports those immutable
artifacts to Tessera's separate `bench_native_operator.py`; PQ imports no
Tessera serving runtime. A preparation plan freezes the source checkpoint,
calibration draw, probe seed/count, input row counts, and numerical tolerance
before native output is observed. Actual joint cost rows must match those
inputs before the independent panel is frozen. Native preparation facts never
substitute for numerical references.

Receipt intake verifies the exact panel/runtime/tensor/route bindings, both
prefill and decode numerical results at the frozen tolerance, and repeated
single-apply measurements. Native allocation bounds require the accompanying
memory trace and matching collector identity. The bridge preserves unknown
native scratch as unknown, and always leaves fixed/full-model resources
unknown. It produces operator evidence, not a complete runtime table: complete
table admission still needs independently measured fixed/KV work and the
serving-unit coverage required above. A readable research rung or a local
operator parity result does not change the runtime pin or serving gates.


The whole routed native bridge (`native_moe_panel.py`, #309) compares actual
module-local attention/expert selectors between capture and probe; semantic
config dumps alone do not include these private Transformers selectors. New
captures record the shared `source_execution_identity`. A legacy boundary
requires a separate hash-bound fresh source qualification with identical source,
runtime, calibration, inputs, route IDs/weights, bias and token coordinates.
The panel seals that proof digest without rewriting the original capture.

The bridge binds one complete
32-expert LFM E4M3 K1 R1024 stack to all 96 ordered w1/w3/w2 members. It reuses
`RuntimeBinding` over validated member rows on the same source and signed
probes, without introducing a scalar group cost. Actual external top-k IDs and
weights are retained before coercion; supported transport casts must round-trip
losslessly. The reference calls the existing packed-expert operation and the
shared QDQ at both input and intermediate boundaries. The scoped measurement
protocol explicitly disables optional activation preclip and refuses clipped
joint rows; the global default remains unchanged.

The capture must carry the actual checkpoint initializer descriptor and eager
backend, with source files/config and calibration bound to the member probes.
LFM routing uses sigmoid, selection-only expert bias, normalization with its
source epsilon and the captured final weights; the bridge never renormalizes
them. A first-sequence M=1 prefix is only an operator shape check, not a served
autoregressive measurement. Native resource evidence keeps runtime workspace
separate from layer storage and incremental scratch. Operator observations
still cannot supply a complete model-fixed or SLO/runtime table.

The preparation/freeze/consume adapter is
`experiments/pq309_native_moe_panel.py`. Its versioned input plan pins the shared
capture-v2 manifest and census, original routed PAC file, exact token draw,
original PWC pickle, all 96 wire/record file hashes, immutable runtime image,
serving configuration bytes and probe policy. Preparation independently derives
each producer encoding identity from source weights and the prefetched full
Hessians before checking original wire decode against PWC. The original router
weights remain unchanged, with int32 IDs and FP32 weights used only as verified
lossless transport. The adapter requires the canonical capture-v2 implementation
and real materialization outputs; historical captures cannot qualify it.

A bounded native integration screen may use only sample zero for its joint
probes. Preparation verifies the actual subset IDs against the full token draw
and keeps the full capture/Hessian provenance intact. `probe_scope` binds the
parent and subset calibration hashes and sample index in the frozen panel and
observation; the subset hash is the joint currency. Full-draw probes omit the
subset receipt and carry null `probe_scope`. A subset screen cannot be reported
as full-draw quality evidence.


## Exact boundary working storage (opt-in)

For bounded target replay, `SharedStateCotangents.fork_for_replay` accepts a
mandatory `max_resident_bytes` cap for the fork's newly allocated compact
adjoint tensors. It requires a quiescent owner after harvest, deep-copies all
accumulators, and keeps diagnostic lists independent. The original adjoints
remain separately charged. Earlier target windows may consume/harvest one
batch's disposable fork and release it; only the final target window may use
the original owner and commit outgoing cotangents. This helper does not itself
schedule replay or change reverse-pass behavior.

`compute_aura_cost_streamed(..., boundary_storage=policy)`, CLI
`--boundary-storage-config policy.json`, or the Tessera joint plan's
`execution.boundary_storage` accepts the closed policy:

```json
{
  "schema": "prismaquant.aura.boundary_storage.v1",
  "directory": "/run/exact-boundaries",
  "max_resident_bytes": 1073741824,
  "max_auxiliary_bytes": 1073741824,
  "max_artifact_bytes": 536870912000,
  "prefetch_batches": 2
}
```

These illustrative caps are not a GLM admission plan. The resident cap charges
all exact tensors in the current prefetched CPU window plus one compact CPU
writer copy; source replay/gradients, decoded candidates and allocator/runtime
scratch still need their independent memory reservation and free-memory floor.
On Spark CPU and GPU ownership share physical memory. The auxiliary cap counts
all retained input/mask/position/shared-state storage, including full backing
storages of views and tensors in mapping keys as well as values, and
conservatively reserves one >=FP32 shared-state
cotangent per captured occurrence per probe. Opaque state owners refuse.
Nothing samples, reshapes, rounds or reorders a boundary.

Each invocation starts a fresh generation only after input/checkpoint identity
validation. The ordinary atomic activation writer publishes exact tensors and
immutable receipts. A whole bounded window is loaded and checked before model
replay; window lookups have no lazy-read path. Outgoing cotangents publish to
new coordinates before retiring their consumed predecessor. Completed layer
boundaries retire after all original probes consume them. Working entries are
removed on normal completion or an ordinary exception; a killed process can
leave an isolated incomplete generation, which is never accepted as resume
input. Existing signed cost checkpoints own resume. A completed-checkpoint
resume skips boundary generation entirely. The policy is checkpoint-bound but
does not change the probe arithmetic identity or signed samples.

To opt into layer-major baseline capture, use the same fields with
`schema: "prismaquant.aura.boundary_storage.v2"` and the required additional
field `capture_order: "layer_major"`. V1 remains closed and unchanged.
`capture_layer_major_boundaries(input_batches, storage=owner)` consumes the
existing `visit_layer_batches(..., boundary_storage=owner)` traversal. Source
layers install/prefetch once, original batches remain in order, exact input
windows are verified before source calls, and outputs are written immediately.
All boundary receipts remain available for the ordinary reverse pass.

Global forward order becomes layer/batch; each batch's original layer sequence,
shape, masks, positions and distinct profile state remain intact. V2 requires
evaluation mode and prefetched source delivery. It refuses observed Torch CPU
or active-runner CUDA RNG consumption around preparation, source calls and
profile state creation/capture. Python/NumPy RNG, other CUDA devices and
arbitrary mutable custom-model state are not certified; supported source
identity and equivalence remain qualification gates. Probe RNG and global row
coordinates are unchanged. All simultaneous live per-batch shared states and
transient final CPU copies are charged to the auxiliary cap, including
potential per-probe adjoints.

The exact files and verified page advice make I/O explicit; advice does not
establish physical release. Profile read/write barriers independently and keep
actual physical memory checks. V1 preserves the source loop to make
byte/order parity reviewable. Its batch-major capture still
traverses all decoder layers per calibration batch. With two source slots,
512 B1 samples do not get a whole-model resident reuse window: layer-level
source payload is fetched repeatedly. This source-derived traffic observation
is unmeasured, not a timing estimate. V2 addresses the initial capture traversal; production qualification still
needs full-scale physical memory and bounded PWC/delta/diagnostic lifetimes. The mode stays default-off until these
remaining production gates are satisfied.
