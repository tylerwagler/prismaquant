# The Sensitivity Card: probe once, price any format menu

**Status:** implemented, unit-tested, **not yet validated on a served artifact.**
The scalar tier is a byte-identical refactor of today's behaviour. The marginal
tier and AQUA-AURA are **research-tier** until a served A/B exists.
**Date:** 2026-08-14

## 1. The problem

Probing a model is the expensive, model-specific half of PrismaQuant. Choosing
formats is the cheap, *platform*-specific half. Today they are fused: `probe.pkl`
carries scalars that only become a cost next to a **rendered menu cache** built
for one particular format list, so:

- a new format menu means re-rendering the menu (and at CB-menu scale, the
  disk projection that motivated this work);
- a probe cannot be *shared*, because it is not sufficient on its own to price
  anything a downstream author might want;
- W4A4 and W4A8 are literally the same candidate, because the cost is
  weight-space only.

The goal Rob set: **probe a model once; the probe is shareable, small, and
requires only that the author specify their downstream format/platform.**

## 2. The key observation

`incremental_probe.py` already computes the per-element diagonal empirical
Fisher of each weight matrix:

```python
chunk_h = gy2_sq.t() @ x2_sq          # H[o,i] = sum_t g[t,o]^2 * x[t,i]^2
```

Storing `H` is what makes a full-detail probe unshippable — the unified-sweep
path documents it as *"47k x 17 MB = 800 GB CPU, doesn't fit"* and therefore
keeps only two scalars, `h_trace` and `h_w2_sum`.

But **every quantity a format-agnostic cost needs is a marginal of `H`**, and
each marginal is a pair of reductions that never forms the `[out, in]` matrix:

```
fisher_row[o] = sum_i H[o,i] = gy2_sq.t() @ x2_sq.sum(dim=1)     # [out]
fisher_col[i] = sum_o H[o,i] = gy2_sq.sum(dim=1) @ x2_sq         # [in]
```

Cost: `out + in` floats instead of `out * in`. Both reduction vectors are
*already materialized* by the existing `h_trace` line, so this is nearly free
and — critically — it is available even on the memory-bounded unified sweep that
cannot accumulate `h_full` at all.

Two further vectors are stored because they are **not** recoverable from the
weight-Fisher marginals:

```
act_sq_sum[i] = sum_t x[t,i]^2      # the imatrix / diag(X^T X)
g_sq_sum[o]   = sum_t g[t,o]^2      # the OUTPUT-space Fisher diagonal
```

`act_sq_sum` lets any format weight its weight error by the activation
distribution the layer actually sees. `g_sq_sum` is what turns an *output*
perturbation into a loss delta — the term AQUA-AURA is built on, and the one
thing `h_trace` structurally cannot supply.

**Free consistency check:** `sum(fisher_row) == sum(fisher_col) == h_trace_raw`.
`SensitivityUnit.validate()` enforces it, which catches the whole class of bugs
where one accumulator is normalized and another is not.

## 3. Measured sizes

| model | units | params | full `H` | **card** | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B dense | 505 | 26.0 B | 104.2 GB | **75.2 MB** | 1385x |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | 391 | 34.1 B | 8.2 GB | **17.4 MB** | 469x |
| Qwen3-0.6B dense | 197 | 0.6 B | 2.4 GB | **7.4 MB** | 321x |
| MiniMax-M2.7 (per-expert rows) | 47,865 | 228.0 B | 0.9 TB | **2.3 GB** | 403x |

A 75 MB card for a 20 GB artifact is a 0.3% download. Scalar-only cards (built
from any existing probe, no re-probe) are ~1 MB even at 228 B params.

**Note on MoE:** card size tracks the number of probe *rows*, not parameters.
A probe that keeps rows per unpacked expert (MiniMax: 47,865 rows) produces a
much larger card than one that keeps packed-expert rows (35B: 391 rows). If
per-expert granularity is not needed downstream, packing before carding is the
lever. This is the one case where the card is not yet "small", and it is
flagged rather than hidden.

## 4. Why the storage projection collapses

The 18 TB figure is *consistent with* the cost of a **rendered menu cache**:
every (Linear, format) pair rendered and stored so its error can be measured.
(I did not locate the original derivation, so treat the attribution as inferred
— the measured card sizes in §3 answer the question either way.) The card
removes the need for such a cache entirely, because weight error is computed
**locally** from `W` plus the format's own quantizer:

```python
class FormatCostPlugin(Protocol):
    descriptor: FormatDescriptor
    def weight_error(self, unit, weight) -> np.ndarray: ...   # [out, in] squared error
```

A consumer quantizing a model already has its weights on disk. They do not need
our rendered bytes — they need our *sensitivity*, which is `O(out + in)`.
Rendering is then done **once, for the chosen assignment only**, at export.

This is also why the card is format-independent: adding a format is adding a
plugin, not re-probing and not re-rendering a menu.

## 5. The seam is unchanged

`allocator_solver.py` already defines the whole optimizer contract:

```python
@dataclass
class Candidate:
    fmt: str
    bits_per_param: float
    memory_bytes: int
    predicted_dloss: float
```

This work **feeds** that seam rather than replacing it. `CostComponents.to_predicted_dloss()`
produces the one float the multi-choice knapsack DP consumes, so an arbitrary
format menu becomes an arbitrary list of plugins and the solver is untouched.

Three fidelity tiers, selectable per run:

| tier | weight cost | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SCALAR` | `0.5 * h_trace * weight_mse` | **exactly today's behaviour**; the fallback when a card has no vectors |
| `MARGINAL` | `0.5 * (row @ dW^2 @ col) / h_trace_raw` | rank-1 reconstruction of `H`; the scalar tier is its rank-0 collapse |
| `AQUA` | marginal + activation term | W4A4 and W4A8 stop being the same candidate |

The marginal form is **exact** when `H` is genuinely rank-1, which is the
sharpest available check on the quadratic form and its normalization; there is a
unit test asserting it to `rtol=1e-10`.

## 6. AQUA-AURA

`h_trace` is a **weight-space** curvature. An activation-quantization error is an
**input-side** perturbation `x -> x + dx` reaching the loss as `dy = W dx`.
Multiplying an input-side error by a weight-space sensitivity is a currency
error of exactly the kind `activation_fair_pricing.py` is a 120-line autopsy of
(84% rung-order violations when one family was priced on two bases), so this
module refuses to do it.

Under a diagonal model:

```
E||W dx||^2 = sum_j var(dx_j) * ||W[:,j]||^2
dLoss_a    ~= 0.5 * sum_o g_sq[o] * (W[o,:]^2 . var_dx)
```

— through `g_sq_sum`, never `h_trace`.

Design rules held:

- An unmeasured A-side returns **`None`, never `0.0`**, so a missing measurement
  can never read as a free one.
- The quantizer's `1/12` step variance is a property of a uniform grid, not a
  tuned constant.
- **No speed/quality scalarization constant.** Speed (`speed_index`) and quality
  (`predicted_dloss`) are returned as separate axes; choosing between them is a
  frontier selection, matching how the byte budget already selects a shipping
  point. Inventing a weighting constant would violate "no heuristics when an
  explicit exists".
- `activation_fair_pricing.py` is **left untouched**. Superseding it is a
  promotion decision on served evidence, not a drive-by refactor.

## 7. Design rules the card holds

**Structure travels; policy does not.** The card carries sibling *identity*
(q/k/v are siblings in one block), shapes, and source dtype — properties of the
checkpoint, true for every consumer. It carries **no** serving policy: that
fused siblings must share a format, and that packed experts need vLLM canonical
scheme names, are properties of the downstream runtime and are derived from the
profile the author names. Baking vLLM's packing into a shareable file makes it
wrong for llama.cpp, and wrong the day vLLM changes.

**Calibration is identity.** A CB codebook hashes its imatrix into its book key;
a card is the same kind of object and gets the same rule. `assert_compatible`
refuses cross-calibration merges and comparisons outright.

**Render basis is stamped, not assumed.** A shareable card is necessarily RTN:
compensated renders need per-Linear Hessians (~100 MB/Linear at 27B scale), which
are not shippable. This matters concretely — RTN-vs-compensated `dW` is
*immaterial at fp4 but ~+36% at fp8*, so a card priced on one basis mis-ranks
8-bit rungs on the other. Mismatched bases refuse to compare.

**Currency is explicit and fail-closed.** Only `DELTA_LOSS` may leave the module
toward the solver, because only loss is additive across units.

**Passthrough integrity.** BF16/FP8_SOURCE are legal only when the source dtype
already matches; the coster returns `None` rather than synthesizing them.
Formats are never rejected for looking risky — banning formats in the coster is
the post-allocator-rewrite antipattern.

**No pickle.** A shareable artifact must load without executing arbitrary
objects. The card is a single compressed `.npz` with a JSON header.

## 7b. FIRST REAL-MODEL RUN (2026-08-14): two bugs, and an lm_head blocker (since FIXED — see the RESOLVED block below)

The marginal emission was default-ON and had only ever been exercised by
synthetic unit tests. Its first run against a real model — Qwen3-0.6B, n=8,
T=512, `--emit-marginals`,
`/home/rob/dq-runs/aura-card-marginals-0p6b/` — found the following.

**Bug 1 (fixed): the probe crashed instantly.** `_compute_precompute_key()`
was called with `emit_marginals=...` but its signature never took the argument
(`TypeError`). The call site's reasoning was right — the resident marginals are
written *into* the cached stats, so a precompute cache built with the flag off
must not be reused with it on — so the fix adds the parameter and puts it in
the key rather than dropping it at the call site.

**Bug 2 (fixed): `worst_unit` could name the wrong Linear.** In
`tools/validate_probe_marginals.py`, the name list was filtered by key presence
and the value array by finiteness, so a single non-finite entry misaligned the
`argmax` index.

**The identity holds, and holds tightly.** 197/197 units carry marginals; zero
negative and zero non-finite entries across all vectors.

| check | median | p99 | max | over 1e-4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sum(row)` vs `sum(col)` | 2.3e-09 | 4.3e-08 | **6.1e-08** | **0 / 197** |
| `sum(row)` vs `h_trace_raw` | 2.3e-08 | 1.0e-07 | 1.0e-03 | 1 / 197 |
| `sum(col)` vs `h_trace_raw` | 2.3e-08 | 9.8e-08 | 1.0e-03 | 1 / 197 |

**So `rtol=1e-4` is empirically defensible** — it clears the real distribution
by roughly three orders of magnitude on 196 of 197 units.

**The blocker: `lm_head` fails `validate()`.**

```
ValueError: lm_head: sum(fisher_row)=1.80171e+08 does not match
h_trace_raw=1.80355e+08. The marginals and the trace must come from the
same accumulator.
```

The diagnosis is unambiguous and the assertion is doing its job:

| lm_head | value |
|---|---|
| `sum(fisher_row)` | 1.801713770e+08 |
| `sum(fisher_col)` | 1.801713709e+08 |
| row vs col | **3.4e-08** — the marginals agree with *each other* |
| `h_trace_raw` | 1.803550720e+08 |
| row vs trace | **1.0e-03** — both disagree with the trace |

The marginals are self-consistent; it is `h_trace_raw` that comes from a
different accumulator. That matches the probe log: lm_head is the only unit in
a resident-only shard (`"shard has only resident Linears (n=1); skipping
Phase-3 reverse sweep"`), so it never goes through the sweep that produces
every other unit's trace. A 1e-3 relative gap is bf16-accumulation territory
(bf16 eps 3.9e-3), consistent with the two paths differing in accumulation
precision or order.

I did not weaken the assertion to make it pass. A correct assertion firing on a
real inconsistency is a finding, not an obstacle (principles 1 and 2). Two
resolutions were put to Robert:

1. **Make lm_head's trace use the marginal accumulator** — fixes the root
   cause, but touches the shipping probe's resident path.
2. **Exclude lm_head from the card as a non-allocatable unit** — principle 12
   already excludes `lm_head` from bpp accounting, and a 20-`layer_config.json`
   check (Qwen3-0.6B through DSv4-284B, 33,326 units) confirmed the allocator
   has assigned it a format **zero** times.

### RESOLVED 2026-08-14: Robert chose option 1. Fixed in `3006483`.

*"Fix lm_head."* The root cause turned out to be narrower and more mundane than
"a different accumulator", and the earlier phrasing above (the Phase-3 skip) is
the *route*, not the *defect*. The defect is a missing dtype:

```python
# the RESIDENT backward hook — lm_head's path
resident_stats[name]["h_trace_raw"] += float(
    (gy2_sq.sum(dim=1) * x2_sq.sum(dim=1)).sum().item())   # bf16 reductions!
```

`gy2_sq` and `x2_sq` are **bf16**, and neither reduction passes
`dtype=torch.float32` — while `_marginal_chunk`, ten lines away, forces fp32 on
every reduction and documents exactly why: *"a T-long running sum in bf16 loses
real precision for free."* Crucially `gy2_sq.sum(dim=1)` reduces over the
**output** dimension, which for `lm_head` is the **vocabulary**: ~152k bf16
addends on Qwen3 against ~1–5k for a body Linear. With 8 mantissa bits that is
~1e-3 relative on lm_head and ~1e-8 everywhere else — precisely the observed
split, and the reason exactly one unit of 197 failed.

The fix takes the trace from `chunk_h.sum()`, which is **what both body-layer
sites already do** (`h_trace_dev = chunk_h.sum()`, `:2528` and `:2759`). The
identity `sum(fisher_row) == sum(fisher_col) == h_trace_raw` now holds **by
construction on every path** instead of as a numerical coincidence. The old
comment's justification — *"avoids a second full matmul"* — was stale on this
path: `chunk_h` is materialized unconditionally three lines above because it
feeds `resident_h_full`, so summing it is free and no matmul was ever avoided.

**Verified by a controlled A/B**, both arms `--calib-seed 123` on Qwen3-0.6B
n=8 T=512 (`/home/rob/dq-runs/aura-lmhead-ab/`), identical `calib_hash`
`feb6ba6e…`:

| | old code | new code |
|---|---|---|
| units whose `h_trace_raw` changed | — | **1 of 197 (`lm_head` only)** |
| lm_head row-sum vs `h_trace_raw` | 3.612e-04 | **7.357e-08** |
| `validate()` failures across the card | 1 | **0** |

Every body unit's `h_trace_raw` is **bit-identical** across the arms, confirming
the change is surgical. (Scope that precisely: `h_trace_raw` is the field the
one-statement diff touches and the field compared here — it is the measurement.
That the marginal *vectors* are also unchanged follows from the diff, which does
not reach them, but was not separately compared.) On a separately-drawn
calibration the same fix moved lm_head from
1.019e-03 to 2.781e-08; the absolute size of the bf16 error varies with the
draw, but it is ~4 orders worse than the fp32 path either way. Worst-case
row-vs-trace across all 197 units after the fix is **1.334e-07**, clearing
`validate()`'s default `rtol=1e-3` by ~7500x.

**The card can now be built from a probe including `lm_head`. The lane is
unblocked.** Option 2 is moot, and deliberately so: a 16 GB-card Qwen3.8-27B
build may well *want* to allocate the head, since it is a large fraction of a
small dense model — which is exactly why fixing the number beat excluding it.

**Incidental measurement worth keeping:** the row-Fisher is *flat*, not
concentrated — the median unit needs **92.9%** of its output rows to hold 99%
of the Fisher mass (max 98.4%). Tempering expectations accordingly: the
MARGINAL tier's advantage over SCALAR will come from non-uniform *error*
placement, not from a few dominant output rows.

## 7c. Why the card cannot yet reproduce a production allocation (2026-08-14)

Chasing the end-to-end DP check turned up a structural gap that is worth more
than the check itself.

`price()` computes

```python
dw_sq      = plugin.weight_error(unit, weight)
weight_mse = float(np.mean(dw_sq))
```

— i.e. the weight error **always** comes from the plugin's own render. The only
concrete plugin, `RegistryFormatPlugin`, renders with the format's **RTN**
quantizer. Production `weight_mse` in a shipped `cost.pkl` comes from the
**GPTQ + JSO compensated** render. There is today **no plugin that serves a
measured, compensated `weight_mse`**, so the card path cannot reproduce a
production allocation — and it should not be expected to.

This is exactly why the zero-churn test in §8 is scoped the way it is: it feeds
the production `weight_mse` into `weight_dloss_scalar` *directly*, which
isolates the **pricing arithmetic** (proven bit-identical, 22,176 pairs) from
the **render basis** (not yet bridged). Both statements are true and neither
implies the other.

**Latent risk, and it is the project's classic one.** `render_basis` is carried
into `CostComponents` as provenance and is **never checked** against what the
plugin actually did. Nothing prevents a card stamped `COMPENSATED` from being
priced by an RTN plugin, or a menu mixing bases across formats. Principle 8
exists because the surrogate, the KL validation and the exported bytes must be
*one* rendering — an unenforced basis stamp is precisely the "rendering
confound" that reverted the JSO wall-off. Compare
[[factorization_currency_dependent]]: `production-render-score` is already
known to be unlicensed across a codebook-basis change.

**Two follow-ups, in order:**
1. **Enforce the basis.** Have the plugin *declare* the basis it renders in and
   have `price()` refuse a mismatch against the card's provenance, rather than
   stamping whatever it is told. Fail-closed, matching the house pattern.
2. **Add a `MeasuredCostPlugin`** that serves `weight_mse` (and ideally `dw_sq`)
   from an existing `cost.pkl` under `RenderBasis.COMPENSATED`. That is the
   object that makes an end-to-end DP re-solve meaningful; only then does
   "adopting the card changes no allocation" become testable.

## 7d. MARGINAL vs SCALAR: fusion absorbs most of the RANKING, none of the ALLOCATION at the default budget

> **Read §7d-bis before quoting anything from §7d.** The rank statistics below
> say the two tiers nearly agree once fused groups are the unit (Spearman
> 0.965). The DP says they assign **different formats to 12.2% of units** at the
> house-default budget. Both are true; only the second is an allocation claim.

Measured 2026-08-14 on the Qwen3-0.6B marginals probe (n=8, T=512), 196 units
(lm_head excluded), RTN render, through the shipping `price()` and
`RegistryFormatPlugin`. Scripts and JSON in
`/home/rob/dq-runs/aura-card-marginals-0p6b/` (`marginal_vs_scalar_rank.py`,
`marginal_group_level.py`).

**Per Linear, MARGINAL is emphatically not a no-op:**

| | NVFP4 | FP8_DYNAMIC |
|---|---|---|
| Spearman(SCALAR, MARGINAL) | **0.718** | **0.569** |
| median rank shift (of 196) | 21 | 28 |
| units moving > 20 ranks | 98 / 196 | 108 / 196 |
| top-16 overlap | 10 / 16 | 10 / 16 |
| ratio MARGINAL/SCALAR | 0.17x – 7.75x (med 0.73) | 0.05x – 5.20x (med 0.68) |

**At the DP's actual decision unit, most of it cancels:**

| | NVFP4 | FP8_DYNAMIC |
|---|---|---|
| Spearman, **fused-group** level | **0.965** | **0.954** |
| median rank shift (of 112) | **4** | **3.5** |
| groups moving > 5 ranks | 37 / 112 | 41 / 112 |
| top-14 overlap | 12 / 14 | 12 / 14 |

The cancellation is **within-group**: across the 56 multi-member groups, the
members' own MARGINAL/SCALAR ratios differ by a median factor of **1.71x**
(NVFP4), and the sum absorbs it. The per-Linear riser/faller pair is `k_proj`
up / `v_proj` down on both formats — and those are siblings in the same
`attn_qkv` group, forced to one format by union-find promotion. (The spread
ratio measures *differential* movement, not sign; "siblings move in opposite
directions" is supported by the k_proj/v_proj rank evidence for that pair, not
by the spread statistic alone.)

**Scoring Linears the DP never decides independently overstates the RANKING
disagreement.** It does **not** follow that the allocation agrees — §7d-bis
runs the solver, and it does not.

**The mechanism is entirely on the column side.** The row marginal is flat
(median unit needs 92.9% of its output rows for 99% of the mass), so the row
weighting contributes ~nothing. The column marginal is where the structure is:
median 90.6%, but the **minimum is 0.00195** — one unit carries 99% of its
column-Fisher mass in 0.2% of its input channels. That is the activation-outlier
structure, and it is why MARGINAL and AQUA-AURA share a mechanism.

**One expectation this refutes.** The natural guess is that the surviving
group-level movement is concentrated in *unfused* units, since those have
nothing to cancel against. It is not: single-member groups are 50% of all
groups but only 30% (NVFP4) / 37% (FP8) of the movers, and the biggest mover
class is `attn_qkv` (15 of 37) — three-member groups aggregating three
different column structures. Fusion damps the magnitude; it does not decide
which units survive it.

### 7d-bis. Then I ran the DP, and the rank statistic UNDERSTATED the effect

Everything above is a statement about **cost ordering**. I first concluded from
it that MARGINAL's "real allocation-level effect is a ~4-rank perturbation."
**That was a claim one level above the evidence, and running the solver
refutes it.** A multi-choice knapsack can leave the argmax untouched under a
large reordering *or* flip it under a small one; only the DP knows which.

`marginal_dp_churn.py` — same card, same weights, same 2-rung NVFP4/FP8 menu,
same budget, the **only** difference being `CostModel.SCALAR` vs `MARGINAL`:

| target bpp | raw DP churn | after `promote_fused` |
|---|---|---|
| 4.0 | infeasible | — |
| 4.5 | 0 / 196 (**degenerate**, see below) | 0 / 196 |
| **4.75 (house default)** | **24 / 196 = 12.2%** | **24 / 196 = 12.2%** |
| 5.0 | 25 / 196 = 12.8% | 17 / 196 = 8.7% |
| 5.5 | 27 / 196 = 13.8% | 14 / 196 = 7.1% |
| 6.0 | 26 / 196 = 13.3% | 17 / 196 = 8.7% |

**12.2% of units get a different format at the production budget, and fused
promotion absorbs none of it there** (it absorbs a third to a half at 5.0–6.0).
The 4.5 row is not agreement: 4.5 *is* the NVFP4 floor, both arms assign 196/196
NVFP4, and a point with no freedom cannot disagree.

**Read the raw-DP column as the result; the promoted column is indicative
only.** The promoted numbers come from a one-shot `promote_fused` over a bare
`solve_allocation` — a *projection*, which overshoots the byte budget (SCALAR at
4.75 ends with 54 units on ~8 bits). The production path is
`solve_with_promotion`, which re-tightens and re-solves until the *promoted*
assignment is feasible, and churn under that iterated path could differ. The
raw-DP figure is the clean cost-model isolation statistic, since both arms are
projected identically.

**They disagree about WHICH units to lift, not just how many — and that is the
stronger result.** Set overlap of the FP8-lifted units:

| target | SCALAR lifts | MARGINAL lifts | **both** | SCALAR-only | MARGINAL-only | subset? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4.75 | 26 | 18 | **10** | 16 | 8 | no |
| 5.0 | 45 | 44 | 32 | 13 | 12 | no |
| **5.5** | **76** | **75** | 62 | 14 | 13 | no |
| 6.0 | 102 | 98 | 87 | 15 | 11 | no |

At 4.75 only **10 units are FP8 under both tiers** — 38% of SCALAR's picks. If
MARGINAL were merely *conservative* (a subset of SCALAR's lifts) churn would be
26−18 = 8; it is 24. **MARGINAL is a subset of SCALAR at no budget.**

**The 5.5 row is the one to internalise:** SCALAR lifts 76, MARGINAL lifts 75 —
a difference of **one** — and they still disagree on **27 units**. The count
asymmetry is essentially zero while the disagreement is at its maximum. So
"MARGINAL is more conservative" is a real but *minor* effect (visible mainly at
4.75, and consistent with its median ratio of 0.73); the dominant effect is a
**re-selection of which Linears deserve the bits**, which no aggregate count
reveals. The churn is attention-dominated at 4.75
(`v_proj`/`k_proj`/`q_proj`/`o_proj`) and shifts to MLP
(`down_proj`/`up_proj`/`gate_proj`) by 5.5–6.0.

**Calibrating 12.2%:** the decision-level uncertainty study found a cost CV of
23% produced only **3%** churn at 4.75 and a **0σ** served effect. This is **4x
that churn**, so it is not obviously inside the "noise the DP absorbs" regime —
and equally, it is **not proven to matter**, because nothing here was served.

**What this does NOT say.** It compares two surrogates **to each other**;
neither is ground truth, so it says nothing about which is *better* — only that
they disagree, materially, about what to ship. It is one 0.6B dense model under
an RTN render on a 2-rung menu, and per §7c the measured compensated cost that
would arbitrate is exactly what no plugin serves yet.

**Revised practical read** (superseding the first version of this section):
MARGINAL is **not** a cosmetic re-ranking. It changes 12% of a production-budget
allocation, in a consistent direction, on the model family that is the dense
ship target. That makes arbitrating it — i.e. building the `MeasuredCostPlugin`
of §7c and then measuring served KL on both arms — **more** valuable, not less.
Expect a larger effect still where fusion does not apply and column structure is
sharper: MoE experts, and models with heavier activation outliers.

**Durable lesson, twice-learned tonight:** a rank correlation is not an
allocation claim. It understated the effect here by as much as it would have
overstated it elsewhere. Run the solver.

## 8. What is proven, and what is not

**Proven on REAL production artifacts** (`tools/validate_card_zero_churn.py`,
2026-08-14) — the scalar tier prices bit-for-bit like the shipping allocator on
two completed Qwen3.6-27B runs:

| run | units | formats | pairs | bit-identical | worst rel. dev. |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `prod-27b-nvfp4cb-5p5` | 505 | 7 | 3,528 | **3,528** | 0.0 |
| `prod-27b-cb-20gb` | 505 | 37 | 18,648 | **18,648** | 0.0 |

**22,176 real (unit, format) pairs, zero deviation.**

Be precise about what that is and is not. What was measured is a **pricing
identity**: given the same `h_trace` and `weight_mse`, the card's SCALAR tier
and `allocator_solver.predicted_dloss` return bit-identical values. What a
"switching the pipeline changes nothing" claim *additionally* requires is
**candidate-construction identity** — that `candidates_from_card`'s
bits_per_param / memory_bytes / legality / fused-sibling promotion match
`allocator_candidates.py` closely enough that the DP reproduces a shipped
`layer_config.json`. **That end-to-end comparison has not been run.** It is the
next check, and it is cheap: re-solve a completed run from the card and diff the
assignment. (This says nothing about MARGINAL or AQUA, which are *supposed* to
differ; see below.)

**Proven (unit tests, 17/17):**
- the scalar tier reproduces `allocator_solver.predicted_dloss` *exactly*;
- the marginal tier is exact on a rank-1 Fisher (`rtol=1e-10`);
- the marginal tier distinguishes error placed on high- vs low-sensitivity
  channels where the scalar tier is provably blind;
- W4A4 prices strictly above W4A8 under `AQUA`, and **identically** under the
  weight-only model — the AQUA-AURA thesis in executable form;
- round-trip, pickle-free load, passthrough refusal, calibration/basis refusal.

**NOT proven:**
- No served A/B. The marginal tier and AQUA-AURA are **screening surrogates**
  until exact full-vocab vLLM KL-vs-BF16 + direct WikiText PPL says otherwise,
  per the standing rule that a screen is never sold as a result.
- The rank-1 reconstruction is an approximation whenever `H` is not rank-1.
  Its error is unquantified on real layers.
- `act_absmax` is a max over calibration tokens and will understate a true
  serving outlier.
- The `8 * sigma` Gaussian range fallback (used only when `act_absmax` is
  absent) is a surrogate, which is why `act_absmax` is preferred and captured.

- **The probe's marginal emission has never run on a real model.** It is
  default-ON but has only been exercised by synthetic fixtures — no real hooks,
  no real bf16 accumulation. `tools/validate_probe_marginals.py` exists to
  measure the identity `sum(fisher_row) == sum(fisher_col) == h_trace_raw` on a
  real probe and *report* the empirical tolerance rather than assume one. **Run
  it before any probe that matters.**

**Required before promotion:** (a) rank-agreement of marginal pricing against
measured `output_mse` on a small model, (b) ~~allocation churn vs a shipped
`cost.pkl`~~ — **done for SCALAR, exactly zero on 22,176 real pairs**; still
open for MARGINAL, (c) a served W4A4-vs-W4A8 A/B before AQUA-AURA is default-on,
(d) `validate_probe_marginals.py` green on a real probe.

## 9. Publishing (prismaquant.org)

A card is one `.npz` plus its fingerprint. What a publisher needs:

- `model_id`, `calib_hash`, `n_calib_samples`, `seq_len`, `probe_commit`,
  `render_basis` — all already in the header, and `fingerprint()` hashes the
  identity-bearing subset.
- Consumers refuse mismatched calibration and basis automatically, so a
  mis-shared card fails loudly rather than silently mis-ranking.

The author-facing contract is exactly Rob's requirement: **download a card, name
your format menu and platform, get an allocation** — with no probe, no menu
render, and no access to our calibration.
