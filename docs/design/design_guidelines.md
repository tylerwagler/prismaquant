# PrismaQuant Design Guidelines

These guidelines define how new PrismaQuant functionality should be designed,
implemented, and promoted into production recipes.

## Product Promise

PrismaQuant exists to choose the right quantization for the right layer. New
work should strengthen per-Linear empirical choice, production-faithful
measurement, and vLLM-serving correctness. A method that is interesting but
does not improve this loop belongs behind an experimental flag or in research
docs, not in the production path.

## Non-Negotiables

### GPU-First Execution

All production-relevant processes should be GPU-constrained:

- sensitivity probes
- production weight-cache fill
- production activation recache
- KL measurement
- polish
- export validation
- vLLM serving smokes

CPU, disk, or NVMe pressure on a hot path is treated as a failure mode. The
default response is not to tolerate the slow path; it is to use, repair, or
extend prefetching so the GPU has resident data ready when needed.

Required behavior:

- use existing pre-cache/prefetch systems before adding new scheduling code;
- report resident bytes, number of entries prefetched, and cache misses;
- make production runs fail fast when required data cannot fit resident;
- keep offline data-build steps clearly separated from production hot paths.

### Self-Contained, Non-Agentic Operation

PrismaQuant may be developed, diagnosed, and reviewed with agents, but an
agent is never part of its runtime architecture. Straight quantization and
scheduling must be a deterministic application function: a closed manifest
declares inputs, hosts, partitions, stage order, barriers, retry policy, and
outputs; machine-readable receipts determine the next state.

Required behavior:

- encode local and multi-host campaigns as explicit versioned state machines;
- assign work from stable data such as sample indices, layers, and format
  rungs, never from an agent's judgment during execution;
- make transfers and barriers content-addressed and independently verifiable;
- make retries idempotent, resumable, and deterministic from committed state;
- publish resource and GPU-utilization telemetry as part of the campaign
  receipt; and
- fail closed on missing, conflicting, or ambiguous state instead of asking an
  agent to infer how execution should continue.

An operator or agent may supply a newly reviewed manifest or fix a defective
implementation. Once launched, ordinary probe, quantization, allocation,
export, and validation must complete without intelligence in the loop.

### One Cache Mechanism

Rendered weights should flow through `ProductionWeightCache`. Activation
captures and perturbation replay should flow through `PerturbedActivationCache`
or the established streaming activation cache paths. New features must not
introduce parallel cache stores, independent preload systems, or duplicate
key-resolution logic.

If a call site needs different behavior, add a shared method to the existing
cache abstraction and reuse it everywhere.

### Per-Linear Decisions

Quantization choices should remain per-Linear unless there is a measured reason
to collapse them. New allocation, cost, or probe logic should preserve:

- per-Linear candidate formats;
- production-faithful rendered weights;
- explicit BF16 fallback;
- measured quality deltas;
- bpp accounting tied to the exported artifact.

Model-wide knobs are acceptable as defaults, caps, or ablation controls, but
they are not a substitute for per-Linear selection.

### vLLM and Kernel Reality

A format or transform is production-eligible only when it satisfies all of:

- represented correctly in compressed-tensors export metadata;
- accepted by vLLM on representative model shapes;
- routed to a performant kernel rather than a slow fallback;
- passes eager load/generation smoke;
- passes graph-mode load/generation smoke when graph mode is part of the
  serving target;
- does not break MTP/speculative decode when the artifact includes MTP, or is
  explicitly gated away from MTP.

Registry support alone is not enough. A format may remain in the research menu
without becoming part of the production default menu.

## Measurement Discipline

Every production candidate needs an apples-to-apples measurement plan before
it is implemented.

For a new numerical method, record:

- baseline artifact or recipe;
- candidate recipe;
- calibration set and sequence length;
- KL metric and validation command;
- bpp target and measured bpp;
- production-cache settings;
- recache/prefetch settings;
- vLLM smoke command and log path;
- downstream serving-suite commands and log paths, including PPL/mean NLL,
  log-likelihood task checks, and ToolEvalBench for materialized artifacts;
- observed GPU utilization and whether NVMe/CPU was idle during the hot path.

The default comparison is method A versus method A plus the new lever, with
all dependent sweeps re-run for both arms. Do not compare a well-tuned baseline
against an untuned candidate, or the reverse.

KL is a screening metric, not a standalone promotion metric. A candidate that
improves calibration KL but regresses held-out PPL/mean NLL or downstream
log-likelihood checks should remain research-only unless there is a documented
reason to prefer the KL tradeoff and the user explicitly accepts it.

## Promotion Gates

Use these states for new functionality:

- **Research:** code may exist, but it is opt-in, documented as experimental,
  and excluded from production defaults.
- **Candidate:** the feature has small-model GPU and vLLM smokes, plus a clear
  27B measurement plan.
- **Production recipe:** the feature improves or preserves KL/bpp/runtime on
  the target stack, passes vLLM serving checks and the downstream serving
  suite, and has tests covering the policy or metadata it changes.
- **Default-on:** the feature has cleared the production recipe gate on the
  current target and at least one additional representative model or shape
  class, unless the user explicitly accepts a narrower default.

Regression or inconclusive results should demote the feature back to research.

### Progressive Local Gates

Local render mechanisms must use the shared scorer in
`prismaquant/render_score.py` unless there is a documented exception. The
default gate is Fisher-weighted output MSE when h-detail exists, otherwise
activation output MSE on the same calibration rows. A candidate that regresses
the active score is skipped and the previous rendered baseline is kept.
For mechanisms that function as initializers, such as FourOverSix before
GPTQ/scale-sweep, the production cache may gate a candidate package so a
neutral standalone initializer can still be accepted when the composed package
improves the active score.

Mechanism ordering is declared by operation type, not by ad hoc flag order.
See `docs/design/progressive_render_pipeline.md` for the current order and extension
contract. Global basis transforms are full-recipe arms, not local progressive
steps.

Research-only transform families live under `archive/`. They must not be
reintroduced into production cache fill, allocator cost overrides, export
metadata, or pipeline flags unless the user explicitly asks to revive the
corresponding archive.

### Rotation Transforms

Rotation methods are production-eligible only when the exported graph remains
vanilla vLLM. A rotation that changes the residual-stream basis between
layers, such as full layer-wise ReSpinQuant, needs a residual transition
operator unless it collapses to a single global basis. That runtime adapter is
not allowed in production artifacts without an explicit vLLM/kernel support
decision. The 2026-05-13 ReSpinQuant attempt is archived under
`archive/respinquant_2026-05-13/`; do not reintroduce a layer-wise residual
basis path into cache fill or export unless that runtime-support decision is
made first.

## Design Review Checklist

Before implementation, answer these in the PR, commit notes, or working doc:

- What existing subsystem does this extend?
- What makes the hot path GPU-bound?
- What data must be resident, and which existing prefetch path ensures that?
- What happens if the data cannot be resident?
- Which formats, shapes, and vLLM kernels are affected?
- What is the baseline measurement?
- What is the pass/fail threshold?
- Which tests or smokes prove the implementation did not create a parallel
  mechanism or silent fallback?

## Exception Rule

Exceptions are allowed only when documented up front. An exception note must
state:

- which rule is being bypassed;
- why the existing mechanism cannot be used;
- how the exception is isolated behind a flag or research path;
- what result would justify promoting, deleting, or replacing it.


### Streamed joint AURA calibration partitions

Explicit `probe_microbatch > 0` uses versioned global-row Fisher probes on the
entire supplied calibration draw. The row seed domain includes the probe seed,
global row index, scope and selected token/vocabulary geometry. Normalize every
partition by the full selected-token count. Compare partitioned execution with
an explicit full-size positive microbatch reference using that same layout;
zero is the legacy layout and its finite probe samples differ.

A logical Linear's weight, activation and mixed residuals sum while signed
across repeated invocations and every calibration partition before squaring.
Gradient norm and column-energy diagnostics also square only after the complete
probe gradient is accumulated. Batch size is part of the existing probe
arithmetic identity as well as execution provenance and checkpoint identity.
Shared paired-candidate and assignment consumers reject mixed execution sizes,
while the row RNG descriptor remains partition independent. BF16 source kernels
can round differently at different shapes; this is also a resume boundary. Full-draw host boundaries, cotangents, declared shared pass state and
existing source/cache residency must be included in admission even though GPU
logits and recompute graphs are bounded by the microbatch.
