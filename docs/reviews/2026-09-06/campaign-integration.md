# Campaign integration review — 2026-09-06 EDT

This review covers the day's pushed main changes through PrismaQuant
`c488b592`, Tessera `f8b87ce4`, and PrismaBuild `645f440`, plus the open primary
campaign issues/PRs and the follow-up fixes produced during review. The sibling
reports are source/evidence ledgers at their stated cutoffs; later integration
and merge status belongs here. The original working checkouts and historical
model artifacts were preserved.

## Repaired campaign boundaries

- The planner now persists the original packed Fisher probe and replayable
  expert draw. Campaign execution binds that receipt in its checkpoint and
  computes packed decisions using shared gate/up projections.
- Population metadata explicitly maps each packed decision to its full source
  population and measured subset. Allocation verifies full source receipts
  without double-pricing packed and expanded members. Full census wires admit
  measured rungs; interpolation cannot invent exportable wire bytes.
- Export scope shares allocation's decision expansion, retaining whole-stack,
  source geometry, wire-byte and static-scale refusals. A partial sample with
  missing unsampled wires remains insufficient for export.
- Merge reuses the journal's checksum/identity reader before rewriting state,
  validates rosters and canonical paths, preserves full sampling metadata,
  rebuilds packed population, unions audit/empty-menu evidence and requires
  shared rate-band/checkpoint inputs to agree.
- Sampling rejects nonfinite/negative Fisher values, invalid probabilities and
  omitted certainty units. Repeated draws using the production PPS design and
  attributable LFM probe validate point estimates; the existing HR approximation
  is not an exact systematic-design standard error and does not gate allocation.
- Common-family projection retries match family names across differing menus.
  This repairs the existing bounded request sequence without introducing
  per-stack checkpoint hashing or a Cartesian search.

## Frozen fanout equality

`tools/pq282_equality/recheck_refusal_order.py` re-merges the saved v7 rows using
current code. It first proves that historical refusal content and multiplicity
match, canonicalizes only refusal ordering in a separate monolith comparison
copy, and runs the existing equality tool across prices, population, captures
and journal identity. No encodes occur and historical files remain unchanged.

Final recheck action:
`1414446fd468e25fbe04ae42a0930b1d14dd6aeeef05307eaf4b5d6a50b8531e`.
CPU-only, sparklina, 2 CPU/8 GiB, native threads1, exit0. Actual output is
**EQUAL**: 3 units, 10,728 priced rows, 3,578 formats, 37 wire blobs.
CAS receipt `ff4c90a604ea9d31c7535453c91ed9865621eaeeadc5cb62ee03a75d7683c497`;
result `72f2398819ba32296f738add5b45ce9777d100df9de0ebaa1e25af0da70633ba`.
Output directory:
`/mnt/shared/tessera-measurements/astra-review-20260906/pq282-recheck-03`.
This repairs equality of the existing bounded artifact; it is not an unsampled
full-model quality or serving qualification. The first recheck attempt failed
at import before comparison; corrected PYTHONPATH/source-root setup was used
for the successful runs.

## Offpath disposition

Per Rob's explicit ownership split, the following findings were filed for the
background workers: PQ#296 source-manifest closure; Tessera#387 empty implicit
export and #388 uniform-control cost guard; PB#301 ambiguous claim recovery,
#302 incomplete cleanup exception boundary, #303 invalid telemetry coverage,
#304 duplicate Netdata jobs, and #306 plugin executable/protocol mismatch.
Background workers acknowledged Astra as final reviewer/merger. PB#307 was
already merged when that worker acknowledged; root subsequently read its
production diff and actual 95-pass/four-subtest CAS output. Runtime/exporter
adoption remains a distinct acceptance step for #303.

One separate prose fix in PQ#297 repairs the launch example's readlink call
following deletion of the historical calibration symlinks. Sampling prose was
also corrected: an unweighted reconstruction screen does not establish bias
of the uniform Horvitz–Thompson estimator.

## Remaining primary acceptance

The existing mixed-LFM result supports an eager TP=1 resident sanity claim:
22 routed owners covered, 52 dense owners unqualified, production admission
refused. Its complete checkpoint and archives rehash cleanly. Tessera release
pin and serving admission were not relaxed by this review.

The recovered Tessera#376 native-operator snapshot remains unfinished
(39 CPU passes/10 failures, no delivered GPU pricing table); PQ#267 must not
invent missing resource fields. PQ#237/#275 still require informative
held-out/interpolated cost and served-quality evidence. Current sampled
campaign prices do not supply missing unsampled wires/scales by themselves.
The older #266 GPU/parity actions cited in checked-in prose were withdrawn or
failed before test execution; their absence is recorded, not called a numerical
regression. Dedicated RDMA mount timing cannot be inferred from earlier LAN
storage measurements.

## Integrated checks and delivery update

At integration `d2604d4d`, 14 campaign/sampling/export-scope files were supplied
to PB's `pbtest.shard` and `pbcampaign` interfaces: **190 passed, 5 CUDA-only
skipped** across 12 completed actions. Three initial 6 GiB actions were stopped
by verified `memory_limit_oom` containment; their required 24 GiB retries passed.
The negative actions remain in `campaign-results.json` alongside each successful
terminal, CAS receipt and independently hashed result. Tests used the frozen
producer `ba582d` at `/mnt/shared/prismaquant-validation/stack-producer-ba582d`,
eligible GB10 CPU environments, two workers/native threads1 per action.

Two further journal-overlap regressions failed before their fix; the repaired
merge sampling/fanout suites passed **40 tests**. Existing projection or serving
entries shared by two journal identities must agree before merge can rewrite
those identities. This is part of #294's trust-boundary repair.

Root reviewed and merged PQ#297 (`0f02ac79`), PB#308 (`cd035063`), PB#310
(`b70f1d29`) and PB#311 (`7b0cecea`). Returned PB fixes, including #312, passed
combined integration: **2924 passed, 3 skipped, 4 subtests**, action
`1239030f09caaff2899b4de83256e60facf8c31f53167cb69b24e0a391dd6e4c`. Root read
the production diffs and actual combined CAS output; separate evidence review
checked sealed source correspondence. See `prismabuild-returned-fixes.md`.

Runtime publication is held until isolated encoder profiling completes. Normal
Netdata installation and exporter service restart require administrator access
not available to the background worker; adoption-dependent issues remain open.
No worker-directory permissions were weakened and no failure was manufactured
to force a service restart.

The final packed-plan handoff at `feac4625` writes a separate source-expert
assignment through the shared expansion helper, preserves the original
allocation and its hash, and binds the derived digest in both preflight and
the plan stage cache. It verifies the derived input before and after calling
Tessera's unchanged translator. Final shell/producer/architecture/docs tests
passed31; the correctly named pipeline contracts and stage-settings tests
passed34 separately: **65 passed, no skips**. An initial manifest lookup used
nonexistent singular/alternate filenames for those last two files; they were
not counted until the explicit correct-path run completed. Compilation of all
changed Python files and the pipeline shell syntax check exited0 through PB.
Receipts are in `final-integration-results.json` and the session evidence
`final-stage-contracts.json`; producer/driver details remain in
`docs/measurements/tessera-stack-driver-2026-09-06.md`.

Root subsequently merged PB#312 (`6a2f8671`) after its prose correction, and
PB#313 (`67a44bb7`), the follow-up passive lock-census identity repair. The latter
has 50 passing targeted tests and a separate real btrfs holder/waiter proof;
its exact-device and kernel-device values differ while one holder/one waiter
are correctly identified. No collector speedup is claimed.

During final validation, root identified six offpath Tessera#387/#388 serial
whole-suite actions that violated the required PB work granularity and blocked
primary GPU checks. Supported PB withdrawal retained their source/attempt
evidence and delegated cleanup to the owning workers. These GPU runs carry no
completed population and are not called passes. The owner was directed to use
affected-suite fanout and agreed that #387's planning-only refusal needs no
additional GPU test. The exact action prefixes were `3ab6b12cd12d`,
`bb8818696383`, `25babedd4bfc`, `8b95f239b372`, `563ac12816d9`,
`9910bb5a4fde`. The final withdrawn claim completed worker-owned cleanup; the next primary
CUDA action was admitted on sparklina without operator intervention.

The five CUDA-only checks subsequently ran in the known producer container on
sparklina: **5 passed, no skips**, PyTorch 2.13.0+cu130, NVIDIA GB10, image
`sha256:9f9b9f05b17531399ba66dc6415b054cf5d68c82270626d0e9150e75c808435f`.
Action `5dc575aae27987dfe32ef98d179fadeafcaac995d0e0d61ac3a1775d0e3b3abb`
reserved one CPU, one GPU and 16 GiB; terminal exit0 and actual CAS bytes were
checked. Receipt `9d1f6448a3b8bfd8fa4e2693b12e22041ee5c09949bc13859e9bc469ee893313`;
result `0c8f8b6e44aa23d7f6d42889c0d694278c06a9986f9cc2d9bd904cbdbe9e6f07`.
An earlier container attempt failed before collection because only `python3`
was installed; the checked-in runner now uses it. These are correctness checks,
not a performance comparison across container images.
