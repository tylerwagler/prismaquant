# Explicit Tessera serving targets through real endpoints

2026-09-04. Tessera #126 follow-up to merged PrismaQuant #181.
Implementation ends at `cbf44281`; merge `577bd89a` includes current main
`fc5a58c7` (only the architecture provenance stamp conflicted; both retained).
This is CPU correctness evidence, not a serve, quality, performance or energy
measurement. DEV contract `1221d2a`/v4 and release PENDING remain unchanged.

## What is connected

`ServingTarget` accepts exact platform/image/execution mode/residency; the
real campaign and allocator CLIs derive each unit's structure from model/probe
facts, not a global model-name guess. All candidate paths, fallback-route
caches and selected provenance retain those contexts. Global token intake is
the union of actual contexts; final per-unit admission remains authoritative.

Export rechecks selected assignments, recorded target/context and actual
source headers before the external producer translator. The existing shipcard
build interface receives exact allocation SHA-256 and validated scope. Plan
reuse separately binds the full allocation hash, refusing unbound older plans
instead of retroactively stamping them. The printed serve recipe carries the
same image/mode/residency and producer checkout with shell-safe quoting.

## Red evidence

PrismaBuild failed-action JSONs below retain the complete output under
`/mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/pb-queue/failed/<action>.json`.

| Action | Pre-fix observation |
| --- | --- |
| `f5170909c3af6734804ba13559943bdc8331040ae475c34abe89423b32a70e8b` | 16 failures: serving-target helper absent and actual CLIs reject the four target flags. |
| `430f151a0e393b44bfdd02ee0e1d040f0cb3d47f94552b8dc5ac84967d38b010` | Corrected-fixture replay: 3 failed, 18 passed. Actual scoped allocator still fails at context-free global literal/token intake before the per-unit gate. |
| `3a7d3cc57a4d6c00159d2c480be90b01f64e6db0033e15d8a084b96eba898d17` | 23 failures: selected export scope/assignment API, CLI forwarding and scope cache identity absent. |
| `9d1902afe7a8d1b51c51d797b284adea2e11d3b8a0acbaaace039c47d9eda036` | 3 failed, 30 passed: `--write-build-json` unrecognized and shell lacks `--build-json`. |
| `f02f32b21d6179c60bb3f662763a2960cb06580c8435ccc0a30a6774925d1892` | Inherited platform regression: expected `sm_121`, received `lm_head` at the scoped sixth policy line. |
| `71765dd3a4ba27d1ce4fa296fde5b92872c861a0b7dbe7f9b7b40aed8bf3e4bb` | 5 failed, 1 preservation passed: changed or unbound allocation still reaches `TEST_EXPORT_REACHED`; printed eager/compiled commands omit `IMAGE` and split paths containing spaces. |

Supplemental earlier export run `fd5e6b5f52f4` exposed five real new cases:
matching source-member predicates were admitted despite unavailable executed
fused projection, body/head policy used context-free admission, and a supplied
Tessera token reached `get_format` as a literal. Two other failures in that
run were test-fixture zero activation scores, corrected without production
changes; they are not claimed as regression evidence. The earlier allocator
fixture also used invalid 128-column shapes; the corrected replay above is
the valid red for global intake.

## Green populations

All actions were dispatched through PrismaBuild on Sparky, CPU-only, one
reserved CPU and 4 GiB, with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=''`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`,
`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`. No CUDA-gated population was exercised. Tests used
the existing PrismaQuant cu130 interpreter and immutable producer source
archive `tessera-1221d2a-src.tar`, SHA-256
`b4755a30d60974ec2758c2060fc4d3954f2e1b7c7bb11602a05f0b783ba60bc8`.
Snapshot sealing excluded only the three tracked external calibration
symlinks, immediately restored after queue; no test uses those datasets.

  no collection errors. Action

  All five skip reasons verbatim: **`Tessera encodes need CUDA`**
  (`test_tessera_campaign.py` lines 194, 222, 248, 540 and 945 in that snapshot).

  Seven touched modules compiled and the shell passed `bash -n` in the same action.
- Review fixes at `cbf44281`: **112 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**, no

  `test_docs_staleness`, and `test_architecture_doc`; shell syntax also passed.

## Boundaries and encountered fixes

This does not close #126 alone. Scoped raw-census/shipcard replay is a separate
worker's integration; final reviewed producer pin advancement follows actual
measured MoE publication. Packed/aggregate source projections and nonempty
executed-shape predicates refuse rather than guess; packed campaign/bridge
work is tracked and assigned in PrismaQuant #183. Supplied prepriced cost
input dispatch is separately tracked and assigned in #184. No shipped defaults,
wire bytes, thresholds or attestation cells change here.

Separate review fixes: `3b3fce05` binds cached plans to allocation content;
`cbf44281` preserves explicit runtime in printed serve instructions and fixes
contradictory current-tense architecture prose. The initial recipe-provenance
and legacy-explicit-scope findings were already isolated in merged #181.

## Final handoff-command correction

After the scoped census worker supplied its supported API, `1084bc69`
replaced the stale printed `--log`/manual-route instructions with complete
raw-census generation inside the exact verified image and allocation-bound
consumer filling. The command preserves eager/compiled and residency; a
printed warning states the producer's unsupported dense compiled proof.
New actual-shell cases were **2 failed, 6 deselected** before the fix (action
prefix `3346e432fed4`, failure `assert '--log' not in tokens`). Final
post-main-merge shell/docs population is **27 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped**,
no collection errors, CPU-only Sparky under the same 1-core/4-GiB reservation:
action `cf4b58ffeb159fd8a23db4e556ba260d0e04a8f5f454aee2adcbdb6fe8c55a83`,
receipt `d7e752e48920a4a4fe58e2ecff88ee42911ed6860f5c514f0e429632f4600eb4`.
The receipt-filling implementation is still the separate integration leg;
printed instructions are not a claim that a gate has been run.
