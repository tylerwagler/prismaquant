"""Opt-in seam that puts the continuous trellis rate surface in the DP's menu.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
``trellis_formats`` / ``trellis_footprint`` / ``trellis_allocator`` /
``trellis_rate_surface`` are a complete, exactly-priced research surface that
nothing in the pipeline imported.  This module is the ONE place the production
allocator reaches them, and it is off unless ``PRISMAQUANT_TRELLIS_SURFACE``
names a manifest file.  Unset, :func:`augment_candidates` returns its input
unchanged and the run is byte-identical to one built without this module
(principle 6, the ``PRISMAQUANT_FISHER_CAP_MULTIPLIER`` precedent).

STATUS: THE MENU IS BUILT, THE SEAM IS NOT WIRED
------------------------------------------------
:func:`build_trellis_menu` produces a correctly priced menu.  The production
seam :func:`augment_candidates` **refuses** when the flag is set, because
eight links between that menu and a shipped assignment do not exist -- see
:data:`UNWIRED_LINKS`, which is the refusal message and the re-enable
checklist.  The first version of this module (40d3e15) claimed the seam's
placement inside ``build_candidates`` meant trellis rungs "pass the same
legality, aggregation and byte accounting every other candidate does".  That
was false on all three counts and is the reason the refusal exists: the
registry gaps crash loudly, but the aggregation gaps are SILENT, and a partial
fix would trade the loud failure for the silent one.

WHY A MANIFEST AND NOT A ``FORMATS`` ENUM ENTRY
----------------------------------------------
A trellis rung is not an enum value.  It is ``(family, body_rate_q256,
layout, schedule, alphabets)``, and the wire's rate resolution is
``256/columns`` q256 -- effectively continuous.  What makes a rung *cost*
something is a measured anchor, and anchors are per-campaign data, not a
constant in the source tree.  So the flag names a file of measured anchors and
this module densifies them.  The names the DP and ``layer_config.json`` see
are the closed ``TCQ_{E2M1,E4M3}_R<q256>`` spelling that
``trellis_formats.parse_trellis_format_name`` round-trips.

THE THREE THINGS THIS REFUSES, AND WHY
--------------------------------------
1. **A profile with no ``target_platform``.**  ``trellis_allocator``'s
   ``_capability_gate`` returns *legal* when the profile declares no exact
   platform (:578-586) -- deliberately, because admission is then the
   experiment's responsibility.  Six of nine shipped serving-profile specs
   take that branch, so wiring the surface to one of them would run the
   allocator against a capability gate that cannot fire.  A vacuous gate is
   worse than no gate: it looks like a check.  So the manifest must name a
   profile that declares ``target_platform``, and E2M1 (SM120+) / E4M3
   (SM89+) then really are compared against it.

2. **An objective the run is not pricing in.**  The manifest declares
   ``cost_mode`` and ``currency``; both must match the run.  A DP that ranks
   an AURA-priced trellis rung against an output-MSE-priced NVFP4 rung is not
   solving any stated objective.

3. **An activation contract the anchors were not measured under.**  The
   hull anchors that produced the measured surface were priced ``W*A16``
   while the native ``_scaled_mm`` routes for both families are ``A=W``
   (W8A8 for E4M3, W4A4 for E2M1).  Rendering identity without execution
   identity is what priced a real A-side at zero once already (NVFP4_CB,
   2026-08-17), so the manifest must state the contract its dloss numbers
   were measured under and it is stamped on every candidate's provenance.
   Where the pinned runtime publishes no attestation table -- which is the
   case at the producer pin today -- the lane resolves ``unattested`` and
   that word travels with the candidate rather than being rounded to
   ``backed``.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
---------------------
It does not render, export, or serve.  ``ProductionWeightCache`` has no
trellis mechanism and ``export_native_compressed`` refuses a TCQ assignment
outright.  This is allocation-time reach only: it lets the DP see the surface,
report what it would choose, and price the choice in exact serialized bytes.

    Unset, this returns its input object unchanged and the run is

    Set, it refuses.  :func:`build_trellis_menu` builds a correctly priced
    menu, but eight links between that menu and a shipped assignment do not
    exist (:data:`UNWIRED_LINKS`), and they do not fail the same way: the
    registry gaps crash loudly inside the Pareto sweep, while the aggregation
    gaps are SILENT -- they would drop every rung from every fused and packed
    group and hand back a plausible-looking frontier in which only o_proj and
    down_proj could carry a rung.  A partial fix that removed only the crashes
    would convert the loud failures into that silent one, which is why this
    refuses as a whole rather than being wired halfway (principle 1: the
    measurement must be right, not the symptom suppressed).

    Enabling the surface therefore means landing those links with tests that
    exercise behaviour, then deleting this refusal -- not passing a flag.
    Until then :func:`build_trellis_menu` is reachable directly, for research
    and for the tests, where a wrong menu cannot reach a shipped artifact.
