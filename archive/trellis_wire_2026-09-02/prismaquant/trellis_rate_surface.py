"""Continuous trellis rate surface: dense rungs from sparse measured anchors.

RESEARCH ONLY.  Nothing here is imported by ``run-pipeline.sh``, the default
format menu, or any export path.

The problem this closes
-----------------------
``trellis_formats`` addresses 761 integer E2M1 rungs and 1785 E4M3 rungs, and
``trellis_allocator`` can price and rank any of them exactly.  What was
missing is the step between: a rung has no cost until something *encodes* it,
and encoding every rung on every Linear is not affordable.  So the addressable
surface was continuous while the *measured* surface was five points.

``adaptive_trellis_rate_surface`` is the complement of this module, not a
substitute: it proposes **which rung to measure next** by bisecting hull
brackets around a target marginal price.  It never predicts an unmeasured
rung.  This module predicts, so that the allocator sees a dense menu; the two
compose as measure -> interpolate -> allocate -> propose the next anchor where
lambda* actually landed.

What it does NOT assume
-----------------------
No parametric rate law.  A global log-linear fit is wrong on this family and
the ladder shows exactly where: E4M3 wSNR runs 11.04/16.79/22.12/27.35/29.57
dB at rates 2-6, i.e. ~5.4 dB per bit until it saturates against the scalar
E4M3 ceiling, where the last step delivers 2.22.  A straight line through
those anchors overpredicts the top of the range badly.  So interpolation is
**monotone piecewise-linear in (q256, log2 dloss) between bracketing anchors
only**, and extrapolation beyond the measured envelope is refused rather than
guessed.  Interpolation error is then a measurable quantity, not a modelling
assumption: :func:`leave_one_anchor_out` reports it, and
:func:`allocation_regret` reports the only thing that actually matters.

Gate on the decision, not the residual
--------------------------------------
The one-anchor campaign established this the expensive way: per-superblock
D(R2)->D(R3) transfer has a 0.32 log2 residual (~25% relative D) and yet
costs 0.04-0.23% allocation regret, because noise only misranks blocks that
were near-indifferent anyway.  A residual-style bar would have refused a
near-omniscient decision.  :func:`leave_one_anchor_out` is therefore a
diagnostic and :func:`allocation_regret` is the gate.

Currency
--------
``predicted_dloss`` means whatever objective measured the anchors, and a DP
that mixes objectives is meaningless.  A surface therefore carries a declared
``currency`` string, and :func:`rate_surface_solver_menu` refuses to build a
menu from surfaces that disagree about it.  Note for anyone wiring the
trellis ladder in directly: the ladder's weighted SSE uses a per-input-channel
activation second moment, which is an output-MSE proxy, **not** the AURA
KL-adjoint objective the production DP prices in.  Those are different
currencies and must not be mixed.

Provenance
----------
Every emitted candidate is stamped ``interpolated`` unless its rung exactly
matches a measured anchor, in which case it is stamped ``measured`` and
carries the anchor's own value.  An interpolated rung is a *proposal*: the
render encodes it for real and the held-out KL gate judges it, which is the
house rule (surrogates generate, real KL selects).  Nothing here may be
reported as a measurement.
