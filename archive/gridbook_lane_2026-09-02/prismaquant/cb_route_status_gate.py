"""The CB export route-status gate (campaign rule R3).

Principle 9 judges serving eligibility *per artifact, at export*: the
serving-route provenance is a **gate input**, not a log. This module is that
gate for the codebook lane. It walks every selected unit, resolves the route the
pinned Gridbook serving release attests for that unit's structural facts, and:

* **refuses** the export when a unit whose payload family the pinned contract
  publishes has no backed route for its declared target -- whether the runtime
  published a fallback-only route (``unbacked``) or published nothing covering
  it at all (``unattested``). A v3 lane table carries no ``unbacked`` cell:
  the runtime never enumerates what it refuses, so *absence* is its only
  negative signal, and a gate that did not fail closed on absence would be the
  ``units_on_fallback_route = 0`` defect wearing a newer schema. Both refusals
  lift on a declared non-native target platform or an explicit per-run
  override, either of which is stamped;
* **reports, and does not refuse,** a unit whose payload family the contract
  does not publish at all -- BF16, a SOURCE passthrough, a stock CT rung. The
  lane table is not the authority for those bytes. That scope test is derived
  from the published ``formats[]`` table, never from a list typed here;
* **records** -- per unit, and summarized on the shipcard -- a unit whose
  decode route is backed but whose above-threshold route takes an announced
  fallback. That is the measured DSv4 state and it is a recorded fact, not a
  refusal;
* **reports unattested** -- loudly, and without emitting a single
  backed/fallback counter -- when the pinned release publishes no eligibility
  table. The counters do not exist in that payload, so the
  ``units_on_fallback_route = 0`` defect (absence of evidence rendered as
  evidence of absence) is unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged.

The gate never touches the allocator's menu. An allocator that wants an
unbacked route is *reporting a serving gap*, and that signal is the point
(principle 1); what the gate refuses is shipping the bytes.
