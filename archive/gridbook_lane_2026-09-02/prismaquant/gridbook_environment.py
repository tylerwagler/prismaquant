"""Pinned Gridbook-0.9.1 serving-environment contract.

Gridbook resolves some dispatch choices at import/model-load time and reads a
few CUDA schedule selectors at launch time.  A gold measurement therefore
cannot treat the process environment as incidental provenance: it must clear
the complete known namespace, install one canonical state before importing
Gridbook, and attest that same state in the serving process.

This module is deliberately torch-free and never imports Gridbook.  The
producer/consumer boundary remains the immutable runtime pin plus the explicit
registry below.  ``scan_gridbook_source_environment`` is a compatibility
check for a separately checked-out Gridbook source tree; it is not a runtime
dependency.

# The values and domains below carry forward the audited Gridbook 0.8.4 set

# contract value: the
# variable must be
# absent.  This matters for FUSED_FP4/FUSED_FP4_MOE ("0" is invalid), for the
# expert-chunk override ("0" is invalid), and for CUDA switches whose source
# recognizes only a non-default sentinel rather than a canonical default word.
#
# 2026-08-30, pin advance 0.8.11 -> 0.9.1 (contract v4 -> v12): FOUR
# identifiers were added and no existing entry changed.  They are the two
# trellis lanes' opt-in flags and their residency-mode selectors, and the
# addition was derived, not guessed -- the 0.9.1 source's
# ``PRISMAQUANT_*``/``GRIDBOOK_*`` namespace was diffed against this registry
# and these four were the whole delta.  All four are pinned ABSENT for a gold
# CB serve: the lanes construct only when their flag is set, so absence is
# what reproduces the recorded gold routes.  The two ``_MODE`` selectors have
# no ``gridbook_default`` to document because the lanes deliberately refuse to
# pick one (``trellis_e4m3_mode``/``trellis_e2m1_mode`` raise on an unset
# value) -- resident and streamed have different in-memory footprints, and
# defaulting would make a footprint claim unfalsifiable.
#
# 2026-08-21, pin advance 0.8.5 -> 0.8.11: two identifiers were added
# (PRISMAQUANT_CB_FP8_GEMV_V2, PRISMAQUANT_CB_MOE_PERSISTENT_B_D2R) and no
# existing ``canonical_gold_value`` changed.  ``gridbook_default`` is
# documentation of what the PINNED runtime does when the name is unset, so the
# three selectors whose unset default moved to "auto" in 0.8.9 now say so.
# The canonical gold values deliberately do NOT follow those defaults: every
# dispatch selector in this table is pinned to the explicit kernel the gold
# evidence was measured on, precisely so a runtime-default change cannot move
# the gold lane's executed kernels without a reviewed decision.  Re-baselining
# gold onto the 0.8.9+ auto dispatch is such a decision; a pin bump is not.
