# Source-passthrough wire contracts + the routed-expert routing declaration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A unit can leave this producer on one of several EXECUTION ROUTES, and the
# difference is not a scheme detail — it decides which loader reads the bytes:
#
#   gridbook_cb              the exporter re-encoded the weight into a CB
#                            payload; gridbook's own decoder serves it.
#   delegated_native_*       the exporter copied the checkpoint's own bytes;
#                            some other loader serves them, and which one is
#                            exactly what the route id names.
#
# ``allocator_candidates.SOURCE_PASSTHROUGH_CONTRACTS`` is the single table of
# native source formats and their routes. Everything below DERIVES from it plus
# the format registry, so a newly censused native format is a table entry, not
# a new branch here: its route, its backedness, its config group and its
# routing-declaration vocabulary all follow.
#
# WHY THE DECLARATION EXISTS. Nothing else in the artifact says which route a
# routed-expert group took. The CB config_groups only name what IS CB, the
# ``ignore`` list only names unquantized passthrough, and the K0.2 activation
# record only names modules that contributed a calibrated fp4 stage. A
# delegated group is invisible in all three — so a consumer cannot tell "this
# layer is served natively, by design" from "this layer's attestation is
# missing". That indistinguishability is the whole reason this record exists;
# ``cb_activation_contract`` is the field that resolves it.

# The scale-plane dtype the compressed-tensors vocabulary reads. A passthrough
# whose serialized scale plane is ALREADY that dtype can be normalized into the
# CT namespace on write (rename + trivial cast) and delegated to vLLM's stock
# block-FP8 path; any other plane can only be read by the loader that wrote it,
# so it must ship byte-verbatim under the CHECKPOINT's own tensor names.
# Widening it instead would multiply the scale bytes and emit a tensor the
# model's own loader does not expect — the opposite of a passthrough.

# something derived from FormatSpec fields. Deriving them would let a registry
# field rename silently change what the artifact claims — a rename is a local
# refactor, a wire-id change is a load failure at the other end.
#
# ABSENCE of the key means "legacy all-CB artifact". That is why the producer
# omits it entirely when nothing is passthrough rather than emitting an empty

# accepts weight-only INT schemes and RAISES for FP8/NVFP4.  A stock group
# naming the embedding would not merely mis-route it, it would refuse to load
# the artifact.  Hence a separate key that only Gridbook reads.
#
# ABSENCE means "the embedding ships unquantized", exactly as in every artifact

    ``cb_target_name``.  This lets one packed routed-expert tensor publish
    ordinary logical ``gate_proj`` and ``up_proj`` groups with distinct
    codebook references while leaving its physical checkpoint tensor fused.
