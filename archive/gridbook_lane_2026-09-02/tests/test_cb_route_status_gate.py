"""Route status is ATTESTED or refused — never asserted, never a vacuous zero.

THE DEFECT THIS PINS, measured twice.

1. The shipped DSv4 87 GB body carries 11 routed FP8-CB layers whose
   ``gate_proj``/``up_proj`` bind distinct learned codebooks. Gridbook's
   persistent-B prefill lane refuses per-role split books, so above the token
   threshold those layers take the announced expand+grouped-bridge route. No CB
   serving lane declared a structured ``route_status``, so persistent-B
   eligibility was never a gate input and a user discovered it at serve time.

2. Its twin on the vanilla-vLLM lane: ``units_on_fallback_route = 0`` in a
   shipped ``selection.json``, reachable only by never having looked. No spec
   declared route status at all, so every unit ``continue``d before it could be
   counted. Absence of evidence was rendering as evidence of absence.

The property under test is therefore about SHAPE as much as values: an absent
attestation must be *unrepresentable* as a clean bill. The synthetic tables here
exercise the gate's four dispositions. The ABSENT tests run against the REAL
materialized Gridbook 0.8.11 contract -- a shipped release that genuinely
publishes no lane_eligibility. The serving pin has since moved to 0.9.1, which
does publish one, so absence is no longer the live state; the coverage stays
because retiring a regression guard on the grounds that its defect is currently
unreachable is how the defect returns.
