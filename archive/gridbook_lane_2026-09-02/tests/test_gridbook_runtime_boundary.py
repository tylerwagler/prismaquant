    vLLM's EngineCore renames itself via setproctitle
    (vllm/v1/engine/core.py -> vllm.utils.system_utils.set_process_title). On
    Linux setproctitle overwrites the contiguous argv+envp block, which
    destroys /proc/<pid>/environ while leaving the process's real os.environ
    untouched. Measured inside the pinned serve image, same process, across
    that one call: /proc/self/environ went from all six probed variables to
    zero while os.environ kept all six.

    That made the environment census structurally unsatisfiable -- it refused a
    correct server because the single process that runs the CB kernels reported
    a destroyed remnant. SPT_NOENV confines the title to the argv area.

    This is deliberately not a relaxation. The census still compares every
    allowlisted name's value exactly; SPT_NOENV only makes those values
    legible, so a genuinely mismatched EngineCore environment still fails. The
    guard below pins that: SPT_NOENV must never enter a compared allowlist,
    because a variable that exists to make the measurement possible must not
    become part of the thing being measured.
