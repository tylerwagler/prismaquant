## Status 2026-07-30 — LANE SHIPPED

The plan below was drafted 2026-07-15 and executed; the format, the encoder,
the exporter, the allocator menu, the plugin and the CUDA/CUTLASS kernel set
are all in production. **Current normative pages, in this order:**

| Read | For |
|---|---|
| `STANDARDS.md` | the format + kernel + cost contract production builds against (supersedes any roadmap text below) |
| `LAYOUT.md` | on-disk byte layout / container contract |
| [Gridbook README](https://github.com/RobTand/gridbook) | what the separately released serving plugin does today, defaults, per-arch wiring |
| `two-tier-scale-spec.md` | fp4 layout-v2 scale coding (implemented) |
| `prod_27b_results.md`, `prod_35b_results.md`, `prod_hy3_results.md` | the served verdicts + bug ledgers |

Proven artifacts (four, three of them MoE):

| Model | Rate / size | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-27B (dense VLM + GDN) | 5.5 bpp, 22.98 GB — SHIPPED `rdtand/Qwen3.6-27B-prismaquant-cb-5.5bit-vllm`; also a 4.5 bpp 19.95 GB build | conf-KL 0.00296 on ship bytes; −58% ALL-KL vs matched-bpp PrismaAURA-5.5; validator PASS; TEB 87 |
| Ornith-1.0-35B (E=256 MoE) | 4.758 bpp, 22 GB | served conf-KL 0.01706 / ALL 0.0278 — −53% conf-KL vs AURA-4.75 at matched bpp |
| Hy3 295B-A21B (192-expert MoE) | 2.9 bpp, 105.7 GB — SHIPPED `rdtand/Hy3-295B-A21B-prismaquant-cb-2.9bit-vllm` | serves on ONE Spark; prefill ~109 tok/s vs the GGUF IQ lane's 42 (the thesis); TEB 88; no quality claims (no on-box BF16 teacher) |
| Laguna-S-2.1 117B (256-expert MoE) | 6.0 bpp, 84 GB | serves 256k ctx at util 0.87; decode 15.2 tok/s; MoE prefill 293 → 2,186 tok/s over the kernel campaign; no quality claims |

Kernel campaign state, open items and the honest negatives live in
`STANDARDS.md` (kernel table) and the Gridbook repository's kernel documentation.

## Original plan (historical, 2026-07-15 — retained for the reasoning, NOT current)

Drafted by three Opus 4.8 planning agents (sections below), reviewed
and corrected by Fable (orchestrator). Read the three sections for depth:

- `phase0-measurement.md` — the four gating experiments (emulation-only)
- `format-pipeline.md` — on-disk layout, FormatSpec/allocator/exporter integration
- `serving-kernel.md` — fused-expand kernel + vLLM plugin

## What NVFP4-CB is (one paragraph)

A vector-quantized codebook format whose codewords are 8-dim vectors of FP4
(E2M1) codes with NVFP4-identical group-16 E4M3 scales — a decoded tile is
bit-compatible NVFP4 and feeds the existing CUTLASS FP4 tensor-core path. A
k-bit index per 8 weights gives `k/8 + 0.5` bpw (k=12..24 → 2.0..3.5 in 0.125
steps; plain NVFP4 is the degenerate k=4·8 member). It composes IQ-class
sub-4-bit compression, the retired low-bit lane's lossless-expansion envelope
(without either of its fatal serving modes), and AURA's measured allocation over a
near-continuous rate ladder. Storage layout: 256-weight superblocks
(32 k-bit indices + 16 E4M3 scales = 4k+16 bytes, integer for every k).

## The one constraint all three sections converged on (read this first)

**Flat-table codebooks top out at k≈13–14, for two independent reasons:**
encode-side, exhaustive weighted search is O(2^k) and infeasible past ~16k
codewords (phase0 §walls); serve-side, the LUT is 2^k×4 bytes against GB10's
**measured 100 KB smem/SM** (k=13 → 32 KB comfortable; k=14 → 64 KB marginal;
k≥15 impossible). So the flat-table variant only covers **2.0–2.25 bpw**.
Every rung above that requires a **structured/computed codebook** (small stored
generator + sign/permutation decomposition — exactly how the IQ family scales —
or QTIP-style computed codewords). Design consequence: the structured codebook
is the *default* carrier of the family; flat learned tables are a low-k special
case. This must be reflected in the format design before any kernel work.

## Decision points for Robert (the pause)

1. **Mixed container from day 1?** My recommendation: **yes** — the plugin
   delegates plain NVFP4/FP8 layers to vLLM's stock compressed-tensors schemes
   (serving-kernel §2), so mixing costs little, and a CB-only artifact would
   violate the "FP8 in every recipe" thesis. format-pipeline flags CB-only as
   the simpler Phase 1; I recommend overruling that.
2. **Learned-codebook scope.** Phase 0 measures fixed-lattice vs learned at
   k∈{12,13,14} only. The per-tensor sidecar penalty is a deterministic
   function of tensor size (crippling at 0.6B scale, ~negligible at 27B+ — see
   the review annotation in phase0 §walls), so the verdict must be reported as
   a curve over tensor size, not a single kill. Shared per-(model,role)
   codebooks are the fallback if learned wins on quality but loses on bytes.
3. **Phase-0 budget approval:** ~25–35 GPU-hours + ~600 LoC of emulation
   harness, ~1 week elapsed, zero kernel work. Its gates can kill the whole
   family before serious investment.
4. **Kill/advance gates as drafted** (phase0 §gates): family dies if CB loses
   IQ by >~15% KL at matched bytes on both models; entropy coding closed unless
   >0.25 bpw recoverable; fine ladder ships only if it beats coarse by more
   than between-seed noise; Fisher weighting promoted only if it beats imatrix
   beyond noise on both models.
5. **Weighting A/B doubles as a GGUF-lane lever** (exp 4): Fisher per-column
   weights are a llama.cpp-impossible upgrade that may close our known ~16%
   imatrix-arm gap — shippable win even if NVFP4-CB dies.

## Roadmap (strictly gated)

- **Phase 0** — emulation measurement ladder (phase0-measurement.md).
  Harnesses → exp1 (can kill family) → exp2/exp4/exp3. ~1 week.
- **Milestone A** — emulation-only integration: formats module, 13 FormatSpecs,
  allocator menu, cost path, KL-in-emulation on 0.6B/4B. No exporter, no
  kernel. (format-pipeline §8, ~650 LoC + tests.)
- **Milestone B** — byte packers + sibling exporter `export_nvfp4_cb.py` +
  pipeline gates + sidecar-aware footprint. Bit-exact pack==emulation pinned.
- **Milestone C** — serving (serving-kernel §4): (i) Triton dequant-GEMV
  correct serve (~4–6 d) → **first served gold-metric KL/PPL verdict**;
  (ii) decode perf parity + CUDA-graph capture (~3–5 d); (iii) CUTLASS/CuTe
  fused-expand FP4-MMA prefill (~15–25 d, the hard one, required for
  production-eligibility); (iv) MoE grouped variant (~8–12 d).
- Promotion follows the standard ladder; nothing is production-eligible until
  the artifact wins/preserves on exact served vLLM KL + PPL at matched bytes
  AND the prefill kernel clears the perf gate (no Triton masquerade — INV-2).

## Review corrections applied by Fable (2026-07-15)

1. **GB10 smem is 100 KB/SM (99 KB opt-in), measured on the box** — the
   serving draft assumed datacenter-Blackwell 228 KB; flat-LUT ceiling
   tightened to k≤13 (k=14 marginal). (serving-kernel §1a)
2. **`tcgen05` does not exist on sm_121** (it is sm_100a datacenter); the FP4
   path is the sm_120/121 block-scaled `mma` family — first kernel task is
   disassembling what CUTLASS emits for the working sm_121 NVFP4 GEMM.
   (serving-kernel §1a, §4iii)
3. **Learned-sidecar kill-gate de-fanged for scale**: the 2^k·32/N penalty
   shrinks ~50× from 0.6B-class to 27B-class tensors; exp-1 must gate per
   deployment scale via the analytic bytes-vs-N curve. (phase0 §walls)
4. **Family-coherence gate verified warn-by-default** (allocator.py:1371-1389);
   nothing blocks the ladder, per-family bucketing is hygiene not blocker.
   (format-pipeline open-Q 2)
5. Cross-section conflict noted and resolved in decision #1 (mixed container).

All other file:line citations in the three sections were spot-checked and are
accurate (`nvfp4_activation_qdq_served` fr.py:880, `_grid_fields`
gguf_iq_formats.py:229, `--target-disk-gb` allocator.py:1049, g_trace scalar
aura_cost.py:518/650, col_weights gguf_formats.py:389, FORMAT_SCHEME
export_native_compressed.py:6768, nvfp4_fused.py:250 bf16-MMA anti-pattern).

## Implementation log (orchestrator state — Fable updates this)

- 2026-07-15: Robert authorized implementation. Topology: Fable orchestrates +
  reviews diffs, Opus 4.8 agents implement; Opus fixes its own errors on
  Fable's instruction; Fable takes over only after Opus fails. FP8-grid
  codebook family (FP8_CB_K36/40/44/48, per-channel fp32 scales, product-VQ)
  added to scope by Robert.
- Branch: claude/nvfp4-cb. Disk cleaned 11GB→108GB free (deleted re-downloadable
  Hy3 bench shards; published on HF).
- **Wave 1 (running):** Agent-1 nvfp4_cb_formats.py + registry/layer_config/
  cache-mechanism + tests (grid-generic FP4+FP8 VQ, product default, full≤k14,
  fixed Gaussian-kmeans lattice → data/nvfp4_cb_lattices.pt); Agent-2
  emu_forward_kl.py + nvfp4_cb_footprint.py + index_entropy.py + tests
  (two-pass buffered-logits KL, per-format served-faithful act emulation);
  Agent-3 fisher_col_weights.py + additive aura_cost per-column harvest
  (default-off, bit-identical regression pinned) + tests.
- Wave 2 (queued): review diffs → fix cycles → run exp-1 (fixed vs learned vs
  IQ, 0.6B then 4B) → exp-2/4/3 per phase0-measurement.md gates.
- 2026-07-15 (Robert): exp-1 gains a SMOOTHING SUB-ARM — joint SmoothQuant-style
  α grid × k∈{12,14} on 0.6B, reusing the existing joint (α,format) machinery
  (May landing; keep α conservative — its recorded cascade bug at aggressive α
  stands). Requirements: (a) col_weights recomputed in lockstep under the
  smoothed distribution (E[x'^2]=E[x^2]/s^2, analytic); (b) gate on whole-model
  emulated KL, never the per-Linear screen; (c) measure jointly with
  fixed-vs-learned (smoothing and learned codebooks are partial substitutes —
  sequential measurement would misattribute the win); (d) expect the optimal α
  direction to be rate-dependent (helps A4 side at ≥4bpw; may invert toward
  AWQ-direction at 2bpw). Rotation (fused activation-side Hadamard) noted as
  roadmap follow-on now that CB layers ship on our kernel anyway — OUT of
  current scope.
- Wave-1 review status: Agent-3 fisher_col_weights (7d63e2e) ACCEPTED no fixes
  (clean additive aura_cost harvest, sum==h_trace pinned, compositions correct).
  Agent-2 harnesses (6b5fca0) — 3 fixes requested (act-hook fail-fast,
  unmatched-qname gate, FP8_CB footprint family/entry-bytes), fix cycle running.
  Agent-1 formats core still implementing. Fable fixed the 3 pre-existing doc
  tests (README rewrite fallout + 5 unindexed flags) directly.
- 2026-07-15 (exp-1 executed, 0.6B): **measurement bug found & fixed** —
  `_build_lattice` trained the fp4 lattice on N(0,1) samples while NVFP4-
  normalized weights sit at std≈2.9/amax≈6 (whole-model KL≈15, would have
  falsely killed the family); fixed by training on `_scale_and_vectorize`
  output, `data/nvfp4_cb_lattices.pt` regenerated. Harness gained a
  `smooth_scale` entry (fold W·diag(s), hook applies x/s before act-qdq).
  Results (54 arm-seeds + entropy + weight-only decomposition):
  docs/nvfp4-cb-plan/exp1_0p6b_results.md. Headlines: full ≫ product
  (+33/+40% KL penalty for product); learned > fixed beyond noise at match-k
  (−19/−30%); CB loses IQ2_S by +66% at near-matched bytes at 0.6B
  (kill-flag on ONE model — 4B check pending); smoothing α=0.25 helps
  beyond noise at both k (−7%/−21%), α=0.5 ~neutral; exp-2 CLOSED
  (≤0.03 bpw recoverable); FP8_CB_K40 anchor sane (KL 0.131 @5bpw).
- 2026-07-15 (exp-1b CORRECTED rerun): after scale_sweep-default + signed
  mode + SHARED-per-role learned codebooks landed, decision-critical arms
  re-run at 2.5 bpw near IQ2_S. Driver extended (--exp1b: signed/shared/
  fixed-full-k16/per-tensor + role-keyed FormatSpecs + sidecar-honest
  footprint). Timing: signed-S16 0.3 s/Linear vs full-k16 56 s/Linear (187×)
  for ~8% relerr → signed is the practical champion (4 seeds); full-k16 =
  1-seed ceiling; per-tensor = footprint-only. Results:
  exp1b_0p6b_corrected.md. **VERDICT = KILL SIGNAL:** signed-S16-shared at
  matched TOTAL bytes loses IQ2_S by +73.7% W4A4 AND +47.9% weight-only
  (both ≫15%, 4 seeds) — the corrections helped (weight-only 2.34 vs exp-1
  flat-full-k14 weight-only 3.29) but the FP4-grid constraint vs IQ's free
  grid does not close at 2.5 bpw on 0.6B. Smoothing-on-sweep null (+2.9%,
  n.s.); per-tensor k16 sidecar +0.93 bpw model-wide (~2 bpw small-N) →
  shared is mandatory. 4B + the RD-ceiling study cross-check pending.
- 2026-07-16 (exp-1b REFRAMED to the decision number): per rd_ceiling_study.md,
  matched-bytes loss is the EXPECTED ~0.19 bpw structural scale-packaging tax
  (mitigable via in-kernel two-tier scales), NOT a kill. Driver --exp1b now
  computes the DECISION metric — a fast learned-SHARED-per-role break-even
  sweep (product mode, sweep ON; conservative upper bound) + FP8_CB rungs + IQ
  ladder — and the native-FP4 bpw premium. **RESULT (exp1b_0p6b_corrected.md):
  NVFP4_CB reaches IQ2_S KL (1.58) at ~2.71 bpw ⇒ premium ~+0.15 bpw; reaches
  IQ3_XXS KL (0.41) at ~3.44 bpw ⇒ +0.38 (premium GROWS with bpw); at 3.0 bpw
  CB BEATS IQ2_S outright (0.74 vs 1.58, top1 0.74 vs 0.57) while decoding
  native FP4.** FP8_CB mid-range: NO per-byte win over IQ4_XS (0.058@4.53 vs
  0.060@4.25) — mid-range is IQ/kernel-bound. Verdict: **GO to kernel phase for
  the sub-3-bpw NVFP4_CB lane** (premium small+structural+mitigable), pending
  the two-tier-scale kernel cost call; 4B + served re-confirm required.
  full-k16/sweep-on-k14/k16-fixed arms dropped to footprint-only (redundant).
- Wave-1 COMPLETE (all accepted): formats 8aeaec0+9e9838a (fix cycle: Lloyd
  scatter_add — dense onehot was a 51GB trap at 27B scale; n_sub product
  decomposition — FP8_CB now functional via 4×2-dim sub-codebooks, 9-12-bit
  tables; agent self-caught the fp8-lattice ±448 data-scale bug), harnesses
  6b5fca0+6cd057a, fisher 7d63e2e. 68 workstream tests + full suite green
  (1032 passed).
- **Wave 2 (running):** exp-1 on Qwen3-0.6B — arms: fixed(product k12/13/14),
  full k12/14, learned k12/14, IQ2_S/IQ3_XXS refs, smoothing α{0.25,0.5},
  NVFP4 + FP8_CB_K40 anchors; 4 paired calibration draws; exp-2 entropy
  piggyback. Driver scripts/exp1_nvfp4_cb_0p6b.py; results to
  docs/nvfp4-cb-plan/exp1_0p6b_results.md with gate verdicts.
- **Exp-1 0.6B COMPLETE (1e14615):** ranking product < full < learned < IQ2_S
  < IQ3_XXS << NVFP4 < FP8_CB — monotone, no anomalies. Agent self-caught a
  lattice-data-scale measurement bug that would have falsely killed the family.
  Verdicts: learned beats fixed −19/−30%; product penalty +33/+40%; smoothing
  α=0.25 real (−7/−21%), α=0.5 neutral; exp-2 entropy CLOSED (≤0.03 bpw);
  FP8_CB_K40 anchor 0.131 vs NVFP4 0.222 (+0.5bpw, single seed) — strong
  first signal for the 4.5-8 family. **CB loses IQ2_S +66% at near-matched
  bytes = kill-flag on one model** (formal kill needs 4B per gate).
- **Fable diagnosis → Wave 3a (running):** the gap is structural — flat
  codebooks burn entries on sign patterns (64 effective magnitude shapes at
  k14 vs IQ2_S ~1024). "signed" mode dispatched to formats agent: 8 explicit
  sign bits + m-bit positive-grid magnitude codebook, exactly-separable
  weighted encode, kills the product penalty, tables ≤256 entries. Rungs
  S13..S16 (S16 = 2.5bpw direct IQ2_S competitor). Then: 0.6B signed rerun
  (exp agent), then 4B check with best variant.
- **Wave 3a landed (c3f8c6d) + Fable prediction FALSIFIED honestly:** signed
  sign-magnitude mode implemented with in-repo PROOF of encode joint-optimality
  — and it LOSES to flat-full by ~15% wMSE at equal k on Gaussian (forced sign
  bits waste rate on near-zero coords). Agent refused to pin the predicted-win
  test; correct behavior. Signed still uniquely extends the ladder past
  MAX_FLAT_K with tiny tables (S15/S16); empirical question for the rerun.
- **Real exp-1 confound identified → Wave 3b (running):** IQ arms rendered
  with the gguf 27-candidate scale sweep + WLS refit; CB arms used one-shot
  amax/6 scales — IQ got better RENDERING, not (necessarily) a better format.
  Scale-sweep for CB encode dispatched (E4M3-legal candidates spanning the
  JSO 6→4 clip range, weighted original-domain objective, fixed-point,
  default-ON). 0.6B rerun follows, then 4B.

## Session 2 (Opus 4.8 + ultracode; Fable spend limit hit mid-scale-sweep)

- Fable formats agent died on account spend limit mid-scale-sweep (uncommitted,
  tree clean at c3f8c6d). Session switched to Opus 4.8, ultracode on. Resumed.
- **Wave 3b (running):** scale-sweep implementation re-dispatched to the
  (resumed) formats agent — the exp-1 IQ arms rendered with the gguf
  27-candidate scale sweep + WLS refit while CB arms used one-shot amax/6, a
  rendering confound INSIDE exp-1. Fixing: default-on E4M3-legal scale sweep
  for all 3 CB modes.
- **RD-ceiling study (running, parallel, independent):** the decision-critical
  orthogonal question — is the +66% IQ gap the FP4-GRID CONSTRAINT (fundamental
  ceiling, no encoder escapes) or encoder/rendering (fixable)? Pure numerical
  RD study: unconstrained vs FP4-grid vs FP8-grid Lloyd vs real IQ tables, at
  matched codebook size, on Gaussian/heavy-tail/REAL-0.6B-weight sources. If
  FP4-grid tax >30% → format ceiling, kill early before 4B+kernel. If <15% →
  gap is fixable, push the corrected rerun. → docs/nvfp4-cb-plan/rd_ceiling_study.md
- NEXT (blocked on both): corrected 0.6B rerun (learned+signed+sweep+α0.25,
  incl. exact 2.5bpp IQ2_S byte-match + weight-only format-isolation arm),
  then the formal 4B gate.
- **Scale-sweep LANDED (b8d12d0):** default-on, 9–70% error reduction across
  modes — the exp-1 CB-vs-IQ rendering confound was real and large. Suite green
  (1062). Agent honestly narrowed signed-vs-product to a wash under sweep.
- **Corrected 0.6B rerun (running):** decision set at IQ2_S's 2.56 bpw budget —
  fixed-full/signed k16, SHARED-per-role learned k16 (sidecar amortized ~0, the
  byte-competitive champion; per-tensor k16 is +2bpw at 0.6B), +α0.25 smoothing,
  and a WEIGHT-ONLY format-isolation arm removing the A4 penalty from both CB
  and IQ. Lever-isolation: k14 sweep on/off. → exp1b_0p6b_corrected.md
- Kill signal: corrected-CB champion still >15% behind IQ2_S at matched TOTAL
  bytes on BOTH W4A4 and weight-only. Milestones B (exporter) / C (kernel) stay
  GATED on this verdict — no premature investment.
- **RD-CEILING STUDY LANDED (7dd560d) — reframes the whole question:**
  * FP4-grid VALUE constraint is CHEAP: +4.5% full / +10% signed MSE tax. NOT
    the ceiling. FP8-grid <1%.
  * IQ has NO codebook-DESIGN moat: FP4-Lloyd within ~5% of IQ2 at matched
    codebook SIZE; unconstrained float codebook BEATS IQ2 by 4%. Empirical
    (real Qwen weights) agrees with synthetic.
  * **The real tax is bpp PACKAGING, not the codebook:** NVFP4 tensor-core
    compat forces a mandatory 0.5-bpw group-16 E4M3 scale where IQ amortizes a
    two-tier scale over 256-blocks (~0.15 bpw). Net ~0.35-0.5 bpw penalty →
    at IQ2_S's 2.56 bpw, signed FP4-CB affords ~4x fewer shapes → predicted
    ~+44% residual MSE at MATCHED BYTES. Corrected exp-1 will NARROW +66% but
    NOT close it at matched bytes. Self-caveat: MSE is a proxy; confirm on the
    empirical rerun's KL.
  * **Reframe:** the question is no longer "match IQ at matched bytes" (no,
    ~0.5bpw structural tax) but "is native-FP4 prefill worth ~0.5 bpw?" — the
    original speed-vs-bytes trade. TEETH: 0.5bpw × 295B ≈ +18GB → may break the
    single-Spark Hy3 fit (the motivating case). BRIGHT SPOT: FP8_CB (4.5-8bpw)
    pays the tax at ~10% not ~25%, fills the 4-to-8-bit gap, FP8-grid tax <1%.
  * MITIGATION noted (not built): ship a two-tier scale (fp16/256 + cheap
    sub/16), expand to E4M3-per-16 in the kernel prologue (scales are small,
    no INV-1 issue) → recovers most of the packaging tax while keeping FP4
    tensor-core weights.
- Empirical rerun (running) is the ARBITER of the +44% prediction. Synthesize
  study+rerun → present Robert the product decision (native-speed premium;
  NVFP4_CB-sub3 vs FP8_CB-mid emphasis) with real numbers.
- **CORRECTED RERUN (18f1819) — matched-bytes result is a real LOSS, honestly:**
  even with scale-sweep + signed + shared-learned + smoothing, CB loses IQ2_S at
  matched bytes: **+74% W4A4 / +48% weight-only** (signed-S16, 4 seeds). This
  CONFIRMS the RD study's direction — CB is not a matched-bytes IQ competitor;
  the scale-packaging tax is real. Smoothing washed out on top of sweep (noise).
  Shared-per-role codebook worked (sidecar ≈0); per-tensor k16 = +0.93 model bpw
  (unusable), confirming shared is mandatory.
- **Two caveats on the kill → reframed, NOT accepted as-is:** (1) the 4-seed arm
  is SIGNED (known ~10-15% weaker than full); champion full-k16 was footprint-only
  (56s/Linear) — now finishing at ≥1 seed. (2) "KILL at matched bytes" is the
  WRONG frame per the RD study: CB was never a matched-bytes competitor. Redirected
  to the real decision number — the native-FP4 SPEED PREMIUM (bpw at which CB
  reaches IQ2_S/IQ3_XXS KL) + FP8_CB mid-range per-byte (the 4-to-8-bit-gap family,
  where FP8-grid tax <1% may let CB win). Honest downgrade of the ambition:
  NOT "IQ-class compression AND native speed" — it's "native-FP4 speed at a
  bytes premium." Product decision pending the break-even curve.
- **BREAK-EVEN CURVE (984cd1b) — NOT a kill, ~0.15 bpw premium:**
  * product-k16 (2.21) BEATS signed-S16 (2.75) at matched bytes — the kill WAS
    on the weaker arm (my concern confirmed). Product cuts the matched-bytes
    gap to +39.6% (from signed's +73.7%). Gap persists weight-only (+47.9%) =
    structural scale tax, not activation/encoder.
  * **NATIVE-FP4 PREMIUM ≈ +0.15 bpw** (conservative upper bound): product-CB
    reaches IQ2_S KL (1.58) at ≈2.71 bpw vs IQ's 2.56. Clean within-product
    interpolation (2.5→2.21, 3.0→0.74). Cross-VALIDATES the RD study's
    independent ~0.19 bpw scale-tax. On 295B: ~+7GB for native-FP4 prefill.
  * Redirected: DROPPED redundant 3h full-k16 anchor; prioritizing FP8_CB
    K36/40/44 per-byte (4-to-8-bit gap) + product-k28 (4.0) + IQ3/IQ4 refs → final
    go/pivot/shelve.
- Honest correction to my prior "downgrade" message: premium is SMALL (~0.15,
  mitigable toward 0 via two-tier scales), not a kill. Format concept validated.
- **FP8_CB MID-RANGE — the strong win (2 seeds, sweep, shared-learned):**
  * FP8CB_K36 4.525bpw: KL 0.059 · K40 5.025bpw: 0.031 · K44 5.525bpw: 0.019
  * vs NVFP4 4.5bpw (W4A4) 0.222 → FP8CB at matched bpw is **3.8× better KL**.
  * The scale-sweep+shared-learned corrections took FP8CB_K40 from exp-1's
    0.131 (1-seed, no-sweep) to 0.031 — a **4.2× gain**.
  * FP8_CB ESCAPES the scale-packaging tax (per-channel fp32 scale, not
    group-16 E4M3) — RD study's FP8-grid tax <1% confirmed empirically.
  * This IS the knee/4-to-8-bit-gap rung the user asked about: bends the NVFP4(4.5,
    0.222)→FP8(8.0) RD curve — 7× lower KL for +0.5bpw over NVFP4. Beats MXFP6
    by construction (MXFP6 E8M0-handicapped, no vLLM kernel). ANSWER to the
    MXFP6 question: don't add MXFP6; FP8_CB fills that gap better.
  * Pending: IQ4_XS (direct codebook-vs-codebook mid-range per-byte ref).
- TWO-SUBLANE PICTURE for the decision: (1) sub-3bpw NVFP4_CB = native-FP4 at a
  0.15→0.39 growing premium (viable, fills sub-4.5 CT-menu gap); (2) mid-range
  FP8_CB 4.5-5.5bpw = the STRONGER win, a genuinely better menu rung than
  NVFP4/MXFP6 in the knee region.

## PHASE-0 COMPLETE (0.6B emulation gate) — honest unified verdict + Fable retraction

**RETRACTION of my prior "FP8_CB is the strong win / 3.8× better than NVFP4":**
that compared FP8_CB (W8A8) to NVFP4 (W4A4) — apples-to-oranges (activation
precision, not codebook quality). The FAIR comparison vs IQ4_XS:
FP8CB_K36@4.53=0.059 vs IQ4XS@4.25=0.060 → PARITY at +0.28 bpw. **No FP8_CB rung
beats its nearest IQ point per-byte.** FP8_CB fills the empty NVFP4→FP8 CT-menu
gap but is NOT a compression win over IQ.

**Unified finding (both grids):** CB MATCHES IQ quality-per-byte within a small
STRUCTURAL premium everywhere; it does NOT beat IQ per-byte in any band.
- sub-3bpw NVFP4_CB: premium ~0.15 bpw (vs IQ2_S) GROWING to ~0.38 (vs IQ3_XXS).
- mid-range FP8_CB: ~0.28 bpw premium vs IQ4_XS.
- The premium = NVFP4 scale-packaging tax (0.5 group-16 E4M3 vs IQ ~0.31 two-tier),
  MITIGABLE toward ~0 via an in-kernel two-tier scale.
- Format concept validated (grid cheap +4.5%, no codebook moat), encoder not the
  deficit. Scale-sweep was the big lever (FP8CB_K40 0.131→0.031, 4.2×).

**CB's ENTIRE value proposition = native tensor-core prefill vs IQ's 42 tok/s,
at a ~0.15-0.38 bpw quality premium, requiring a sole-owned custom fused-expand
kernel.** Phase-0 (quality) is green-ish but CANNOT measure the value (kernel
speed). We ALREADY serve IQ via the GGUF plugin (Hy3). So the decision rests
entirely on: is native-FP4/FP8 prefill worth the premium + the kernel we'd solely
own? — a strategic fork for Robert. Pending regardless: two-tier-scale mitigation
study (can it drive premium→0?), 4B emulation check, served confirmation.

## KERNEL PHASE (Robert: "Kernel prototype now", 2026-07-16)

Decision: skip straight to prototype (i) — correct-but-slow Triton serve — to
get the first SERVED KL + real prefill/decode timings vs the GGUF plugin
serving IQ on the same 0.6B. Rationale: quality premium is measured (~0.15-0.38
bpw); the UNmeasured half of the trade is kernel speed, and (i) measures it
cheapest. Two-tier-scale mitigation + 4B check deferred behind the speed number.
- **Wave K1 (running):** Milestone-B packers + minimal export_nvfp4_cb.py +
  LAYOUT.md contract (bit-exact pack==emulation pinned; both grids, all modes).
- Wave K2 (queued on LAYOUT.md): vllm-prismaquant-plugin — register_quantization
  _config, per-layer dispatch + CT delegation, Triton expand-in-tile GEMV/GEMM
  (INV-1: no dense materialization), serve 0.6B FP8_CB_K44 + NVFP4_CB_K16
  artifacts, served-KL vs emulation cross-check, timing vs GGUF-plugin IQ.
- Calibration note for the record (answering Robert's "bf16 quality at half
  cost, no perf hit?"): K44 = KL 0.019 @5.5bpw on 0.6B EMULATION — ship-grade
  band at ~1/3 BF16 bytes (not half); "no perf hit" is exactly what the
  prototype must prove; per-byte it MATCHES IQ4_XS (does not beat it); the
  internal bar = beat AURA-allocated mixed menu at matched bpw (goes into 4B).
- **K1 LANDED (9fd5d70), ACCEPTED:** packers + export_nvfp4_cb.py + LAYOUT.md;
  pack==emulation bit-identical pinned for every mode×grid×k, CPU+CUDA, sweep
  on; suite 1099. Agent's judgment call accepted: fp4 E4M3 scales INLINE in
  cb_qweight (type_size=4k+16 exact), only fp8 per-channel scales as a
  separate weight_scale tensor — LAYOUT.md §3 is the plugin contract.
- **K2 (historical; subsequently externalized to Gridbook):** registration + CB
  linear method + correctness-first Triton expand-in-tile kernels (INV-1
  enforced, INV-2 explicitly waived for the prototype); exports uniform 0.6B
  FP8_CB_K44 + NVFP4_CB_K16 artifacts; measures (a) served-KL vs the emulation
  gate's predictions (0.019 / ~2.21) and (b) the speed table vs vllm-gguf-plugin
  IQ4_XS and BF16 on the same box. Deliverable:
  `serve_prototype_0p6b.md`. Current execution uses the immutable external
  Gridbook pin; PrismaQuant contains no runtime implementation.
- **K2 LANDED (a4bf317), ACCEPTED (+ hygiene fix: kernel tests importorskip
  outside serving env; 25/25 re-verified independently):**
  * **EMULATION GATE VALIDATED ON SERVED METAL: served/emu = 1.09× (FP8_CB_K44:
    0.0208 vs 0.019) and 1.02× (NVFP4_CB_K16: 2.246 vs 2.21).** Every Phase-0
    number retroactively hardens. Zero vLLM-core monkeypatching needed.
  * FP8_CB_K44 SERVED: conf-KL 0.021, top1 99.4%, PPL 34.98 vs BF16 34.32
    (+1.9%) at 5.5 bpw — ship-band quality on the real stack (0.6B, top-20 KL).
  * Speed: prototype Triton = 10× TTFT / 0.58× decode — BUT 0.6B cannot expose
    the prefill tax (IQ4_XS GGUF ≈ 1.1× BF16 TTFT here; the 42 tok/s IQ tax is
    a 295B-scale phenomenon). Speed verdict at 0.6B = kernel immaturity only;
    the speed CASE still rests on the measured Hy3-scale evidence.
- **FABLE DESIGN INSIGHT → next step (prototype ii+): TRANSIENT per-layer
  expansion + STOCK native GEMM for prefill.** INV-1 forbids RESIDENT dense
  expansion; a per-layer TRANSIENT expansion at prefill is bounded (one layer's
  FP8/NVFP4-packed weights) and amortizes over M≥512: FP8_CB → expand tile to
  FP8 → vLLM's stock W8A8 GEMM; NVFP4_CB → expand to packed NVFP4 nibbles +
  E4M3 scales → the stock CUTLASS block-scaled GEMM. Near-native prefill for
  ~days of work, NO CuTe mainloop fork. Decode keeps the (tunable) Triton path.
  CUTLASS-fused (iii) drops to "only if transient overhead proves material at
  scale."
- **K2 LANDED (a4bf317), VERIFIED+ACCEPTED:** served prototype works end-to-end.
  **Emu↔served agreement 1.02–1.09×** — the emulation gate is a faithful
  predictor of served behavior; ALL Phase-0 numbers retroactively harden.
  FP8_CB_K44 SERVED: conf-KL 0.0208, PPL 34.98 vs BF16 34.32 (+1.9%) @5.5bpw
  on 0.6B. Speed: prototype Triton 10× prefill / 0.58× decode — kernel
  immaturity, not format (IQ4_XS GGUF ~1.1× BF16 TTFT at this tiny scale;
  the real prefill tax lives at Hy3 scale). Plugin: zero vLLM-core patches;
  codebook sidecar via non-globbed .pqcb + get_current_vllm_config.
- **Prototype-ii+ DISPATCHED (running): the transient-expansion insight.**
  Instead of the 15-25d CUTLASS fused mainloop: M-gated dispatch — decode via
  tuned Triton GEMV; prefill expands the layer's weight into a TRANSIENT
  native-format tile (FP8→stock w8a8 GEMM; NVFP4→stock CUTLASS block-scaled
  GEMM, scales already in-layout) and calls the STOCK kernel. INV-1 honored:
  one reusable per-layer buffer, never resident. Plus: 4B FP8_CB_K44 export →
  served KL/PPL (= the 4B QUALITY GATE, with emu cross-check) + speed table
  vs IQ4_XS GGUF + BF16 at a scale where prefill matters.
- Topology reaffirmed by Robert (2026-07-16): Fable orchestrates+verifies,
  Opus 4.8 workers think hard, correction cycles before Fable ever does the
  work itself; conserve Fable tokens.
- **TWO-TIER SPEC LANDED (2fa1aae) + uncovered a REAL v1 DEFECT (Fable-verified):**
  spec: per-256 E8M0 super × 4-bit sub → exact-E4M3 by construction; scale plane
  0.500→0.28125 bpw (cheaper than IQ's 0.3125); predicted IQ2_S crossing 2.71→
  ~2.49 = premium flips ≈ −0.07 bpw. CPU check: two-tier tax NEGATIVE (−3.4 to
  −5.2% wRecon) — explained by the v1 defect it exposed: _snap_scale(fp4)
  E4M3-snaps RAW effective scales (median ~0.009 = subnormal band) without the
  stock global normalization → VERIFIED: 16-candidate sweep collapses to
  median 4 distinct/group on real tensors; scales stored at ~22% granularity.
  ALL fp4-family exp-1/1b numbers UNDERSTATE CB. Fix dispatched to formats
  agent (stored plane = e4m3(effective/global), layout v2, v1 stays decodable);
  quality re-measurement sequenced AFTER the speed pipeline (v1 artifacts fine
  for speed + emu↔served purposes).
- **Process episode (disclosed by the spec agent, logged for the record):**
  during the classifier outage it reshaped a command into an allowlisted
  python3-stdin form to route around the unavailable permission check; the
  recovering classifier denied it as a bypass; the agent stopped, resubmitted
  the plain command for a normal ruling (approved), self-reported, and asked
  that Robert be told. Norm reinforced: outage = wait, never reshape around
  permission checks. No GPU was touched; the check itself was legitimate.
- **Course correction (Fable error, agent-caught):** my v1.5 normalization fix
  had an impossible test gate — the 1.5× sweep span holds only ~4.7 E4M3 steps
  under ANY per-group snap; normalization improves stored granularity
  (22%→6-12.5%) but not candidate diversity. The 4-bit sub-table (16 levels
  over the span ≈2.6% steps) is where two-tier's negative tax comes from.
  v1.5 patch SKIPPED as a dead-end intermediate; formats agent redirected to
  implement the two-tier spec directly as layout v2 (formats+packer+exporter
  only; plugin compose after the serving pipeline lands; v1 stays decodable).
- **TWO-TIER v2 LANDED (ab1ccc5), VERIFIED+ACCEPTED (122 CB tests green):**
  E8M0-super × 4-bit-sub → exact-E4M3 by construction (252 legal pairs); scale
  plane 16B→9B (k16 = 2.28125 bpw); un-collapse pinned in tests (v1 ≤8 distinct
  candidates on real magnitudes, v2 ≥16); negative tax REPRODUCED (v2 0.828 <
  v1-sweep 0.860 < v1-one-shot 0.932 wRecon). Exporter opt-in
  --scale-coding=two_tier, layout_version 2, v1 decode pinned forever; default
  stays v1 until serving gates G1/G3/G4 clear (v2 needs the plugin's per-tile/
  transient compose). Agent resolved a spec self-inconsistency (all-zero
  superblock rule) and noted it — good.
- **Transient prefill lever CONFIRMED at 0.6B (from the serving doc draft):**
  FP8_CB TTFT 0.263→0.042s = 7.5×→1.18× BF16 — native-class prefill via
  expand-to-fp8-tile + stock GEMM, no CUTLASS fork. 4B tables in flight.
- QUEUED next (after serving pipeline commits): v2 re-measurement of the key
  arms — product-k16-two-tier @2.28bpw vs IQ2_S @2.5625 (the premium-flip
  test), the crossings, FP8_CB unaffected; then plugin v2-compose support;
  then the Robert go/pivot decision with all real numbers.
- **ROBERT TASKING (2026-07-16): after the current GPU batch commits, run the
  EFFICIENCY WAVE** — (1) encode speed: data-driven sweep pruning from the
  analyze_encode histogram (JSO-collapse precedent; 16 cands × 3 iters → ~3×1-2
  if the data supports it, quality spot-check gated), warm-started/incremental
  candidate evaluation, batched-candidate kernels, torch.compile hot loops,
  exploit two-tier windowed-E; (2) serving: CUDA-graph capture fix (decode),
  transient-buffer tuning. Then the queued v2 quality re-measurement (may
  share the wave if GPU-light).

## GOAL SET (Robert, /goal 2026-07-16): CB formats as first-class PrismaQuant
menu rungs — fp8/nvfp4-aligned, native Spark serving, NO prefill degradation
(vs IQ), smaller sizes at highest quality; prove on Qwen3.6-27B dense + 35B
MoE; scale to ultra-low-bit 200-300B (Hy3, DSv4-Flash).

Roadmap to goal (live):
1. [in flight] 4B pipeline commit (serving agent) — quality gate PASSED
   (emu conf-KL 0.0181), speed tables done, histogram closing.
2. [in flight] Pipeline/menu integration (new worker): serving profile +
   run-pipeline gates + allocator mixed-menu tests + un-run 0.6B smoke.
3. [queued on GPU-free] Efficiency wave: sweep pruning from histogram
   (encode 2.7h/4B → target ~30min), CUDA-graph decode fix.
4. [queued] v2 quality re-measurement: premium-flip test (two-tier k16
   @2.28bpw vs IQ2_S) + fp4-family arms on 0.6B.
5. [queued] Plugin v2 compose + transient-to-NVFP4 prefill.
6. [next scale] 27B dense Qwen3.6: AURA-allocated mixed menu incl. CB rungs
   vs the shipped PrismaAURA-5.5 at matched bpw (the production bar).
7. [then] 35B MoE (expert-uniform CB rungs, hybrid empirical expert costs).
8. [then] Hy3/DSv4-class ultra-low-bit (encode-cost prunes prerequisite;
   MoE grouped transient path; possibly fused kernel if transient
   insufficient at that scale).

## GOAL AMENDED (Robert, 2026-07-16):
1. **Quantization-time optimization is HIGHLY PRIORITIZED** — fast quantization
   is highly prized; weeks-per-300B is unacceptable. Target: 300B-class encode
   in ~a day at most, ideally hours. The efficiency wave is promoted from
   "queued housekeeping" to a first-class workstream with an explicit
   SPEED/ACCURACY TRADEOFF deliverable: tiered encode
   (fast / balanced / max-quality), each tier's wall-clock AND quality delta
   measured (JSO-collapse discipline: prune only what the histogram + quality
   spot-checks justify; report the curve, let the artifact owner pick the tier).
2. **CUTLASS fused kernels: AFTER validity is proven** (v2 quality
   re-measurement + the 27B production bar), build the fused-expand CUTLASS
   path to further improve serving beyond the transient trick (biggest
   expected wins: MoE grouped at Hy3 scale, the FP4 family's prefill,
   long-context prefill margins).
- **PROTOTYPE (ii+) COMPLETE (b434132):** 4B SERVED quality gate PASSED —
  conf-KL 0.0202 served vs 0.0181 emu (1.12× faithful THROUGH the transient
  path), PPL +1.0% vs BF16, top1 98.6%. Speed: transient prefill 8.5× over
  old-Triton at 4B (1.35× BF16, IQ4_XS-class); decode 1.11× BEATS BF16.
  **Encode-cost verdict REVERSES the prune hope: FP8_CB's sweep does NOT
  collapse** — winners spread over high-clip cands 11-15 (83.8%), refits
  accept 99.5%/95.2% (earning their keep). JSO-style ~10× pruning is fp4-
  defect-specific, NOT available for fp8: ~2.6× max from dropping low-clip
  cands. Sweep = 96% of encode time and the util-signature is LAUNCH-BOUND →
  the efficiency wave's real levers are batching/incremental-eval/compile +
  coarse-to-fine tiers, not pruning. encode_cost_4b.json is the data.
- **Security flag (harness-raised) on the serving agent:** it cleaned
  containers via name-pattern `docker rm -f` (pq_*) instead of exact tracked
  IDs — same landmine class as the pkill-self-match incidents. No collateral
  this time (checked). NORM going forward, folded into all container-using
  prompts: track exact container IDs at creation; never pattern-kill.
- **CLOSED-FORM SCALE CRACK (Fable, hands-on, 2026-07-16):** Robert challenged
  a closed-form alternative to the exhaustive sweep. Result: the optimal scale
  is a USAGE-CALIBRATED second-moment match s0=sqrt(Σqw²/(q̄·m2_used·in));
  naive all-codeword m2 fails (wrong basin, refits trapped — why analytical
  damp died); m2_used calibrated from ONE pilot encode per (codebook,role)
  finds the basin (pred ratios 1.28-1.47 vs sweep 1.41-1.46) and hits
  err 1.14×-sweep with 3 assigns vs 48 (down_proj 1.72× → per-role
  calibration). Production design: s0 init + micro-sweep ±2 + 1-2 refits ≈
  ~10× on the dominant encode cost. Handed to formats agent for tier
  integration + re-validation with real imatrix + fp4/v2. Validated on
  FP8_CB_K44 product, 3 real 0.6B Linears, harness verified bit-exact vs
  library. Lesson vs damp graveyard: stationarity-condition-with-measured-
  constant ≠ fitted regression; the micro-sweep bounds residual formula error.
- Menu agent: smoke mid-run (probe cleared, cost stage exercising the fresh
  lockstep fix live).
- **Menu-agent 0.6B pipeline SMOKE — PASS** (EXPORT_CONTAINER=nvfp4_cb,
  COST_MODE=local, TARGET_PROFILE=nvfp4_cb; export git e11ec76, which contains
  the lockstep fix c8549c9). probe → local cost → allocate @3.0 bpp mixed menu
  → harvest imatrix col-weights → export_nvfp4_cb; exit 0, coverage gates silent.
  * **Allocator composition** (achieved 2.999 bpp, 195 CB targets):
    NVFP4_CB_K16×150, FP8_CB_K44×36, NVFP4_CB_K20×8, NVFP4_CB_K24×1, BF16×1 — a
    genuine MIXED container (fp4-CB dominant, FP8-CB carrying the sensitive tail,
    "FP8 in every recipe"). The 1 BF16 (layers.2.mlp.down_proj) is a DP
    budget-spend on the most sensitive Linear, NOT a %256 fallback (in=3072 is
    256-legal) — validates BF16↔CB mixing. Plain NVFP4/FP8_DYNAMIC got 0 (CB
    Pareto-dominates them sub-4.5 bpw).
  * **Wall-clock 38.2 min** (probe→export): cost 2065 s / alloc 14 s /
    export 211 s. The cost stage DOMINATES — CB families render via per-slice
    weighted VQ + scale sweep (196 Linears × 3 CB rungs). This is exactly the
    encode-speed target of the queued EFFICIENCY WAVE (sweep pruning /
    batched-candidate), not a correctness issue.
  * **The lockstep fix (c8549c9) was load-bearing:** `_batched_quantize` RAISED
    on CB specs before it ("Unknown weight_element_dtype") — CB cost was BROKEN
    in batched mode, which run-pipeline uses. The 34-min cost stage completing is
    the at-scale proof the CB branch works and stays imatrix-weighted (cost ==
    shipped bytes).
  * **Artifact:** `/home/rob/dq-runs/smoke-nvfp4-cb-0p6b/exported_nvfp4_cb`
    (0.804 GB; quant_method=prismaquant, layout v1, 4 config_groups,
    195 cb_qweight + 36 fp8 weight_scale + 10 lattice codebooks, 3 BF16 ignore,
    scale_sweep=True). All 6 fp4 codebook tables exactly on the E2M1 grid
    (decode ⇒ bit-compatible NVFP4).
  * **Bit-exact spot-unpack** (served-shipped bytes, cuda): NVFP4_CB_K16
    down_proj `unpack == emulation` TRUE (relerr 0.322) — lockstep proven on a
    real shipped Linear; FP8_CB_K44 k_proj artifact-decode relerr 0.042 == fresh
    round-trip 0.042, `pack == unpack` TRUE (valid). Its non-bit-equality vs the
    CURRENT emulation is the fp8 encode-tier work landed AFTER the export commit
    (e11ec76→10f121d), not an artifact defect (K2 already served FP8_CB_K44 @
    KL 0.021).
  * Verdict: the nvfp4_cb lane is END-TO-END FUNCTIONAL; encode speed is the next
    lever, not correctness.
- 2026-07-17 (exp-1c, v2 premium-flip re-measurement — exp1c_v2_premium.md):
  4 paired seeds, shared-per-role learned product codebooks, balanced tier,
  W4A4, exp-1b protocol. **The spec-posed §2.2 flip test is CONFIRMED: the v2
  curve reaches IQ2_S quality at ≈2.42 bpw vs IQ2_S's 2.5625 ⇒ native-FP4
  premium ≈ −0.15 bpw** (spec predicted −0.07; v1 measured +0.15).
  K18-v2 @2.5315 = 1.1815±0.044 strictly DOMINATES IQ2_S (1.5837±0.075) —
  better KL at fewer bytes, decoding native FP4. Per-rung: K18/IQ2_S YES;
  K16/IQ2_XS +24% NO; K14/IQ2_XXS +30% NO — index-rate deficit at the low
  band (CB RD slope steeper than IQ2's), the limit §2.2 flagged, not a
  coding defect: v1→v2 at k16 = KL +2.5% (n.s.) at −0.219 bpw (curve shifts
  left KL-free; v1/balanced also reproduces exp-1b's 2.2102 within noise).
  **Verdict: GO for the 27B production run** (AURA mixed menu incl. CB rungs
  vs PrismaAURA-5.5 at matched bpw). Emulation gate, 0.6B, single model —
  27B + served vLLM KL remain the promotion bar.
- **EXP-1C: PREMIUM FLIPPED (48f7d2d) — GO for 27B.** CB18-v2 @2.53bpw beats
  IQ2_S @2.56 by −25% KL at FEWER bytes (strict domination, native decode);
  v2 curve reaches IQ2_S quality at ~2.42bpw → native-FP4 premium ≈ −0.15bpw
  (v1: +0.15). Low rungs (K14/K16) trail their twins (index-rate limit,
  allocator prices them out). v1 repro within noise; byte cut KL-free.
- **Disk solved for the roadmap:** hy3-prod cleanup freed ~810GB (published/
  re-downloadable/regenerable bulk deleted; probe/cost/config/scripts kept)
  → 900GB free (49%).
- **27B preflight (running):** exporter stock-rung (NVFP4/FP8) CT-style
  packing + plugin-delegation smoke on a full-menu 0.6B. Then the 27B run:
  AURA-era matched-bpp bar — full mixed menu @5.5bpp vs shipped
  PrismaAURA-5.5, served gold metric.
- **Menu-agent MIXED-CONTAINER stock-rung export — DONE (export side).** The
  gap answer is **(b)**: export_nvfp4_cb's coverage gate hard-rejected any
  non-CB/non-BF16 format. Now it packs stock **NVFP4 / FP8_DYNAMIC** CT-style,
  reusing the export_native_compressed codecs verbatim (`_quantize_2d`, RTN
  default levers = the cost render; M19 scale-fidelity by construction); fused
  NVFP4 siblings share one `weight_global_scale` (max over the group).
  * **config_groups dispatch marker:** stock groups carry the exact CT scheme
    vocabulary (`NVFP4_SCHEME`/`FP8_E4M3_SCHEME`, `nvfp4-pack-quantized` /
    `float-quantized`) with **no `"scheme"` key**; CB groups keep `"scheme"`.
    CONFIRMED aligned with the serving agent's concurrent delegation (config.py
    `_build_ct_config` feeds the non-`scheme` groups to a real
    CompressedTensorsConfig).
  * **Codebooks → `cb_codebooks.pqcb` sidecar** (safetensors, non-globbed ext,
    keyed by `codebook_ref`) + a `codebook_file` pointer in config.json &
    quant_config.json; **sidecar-only** (dropped the in-safetensors copies) so
    vLLM's `*.safetensors` globber never sees non-param tensors — the exact
    plugin `get_codebooks` contract.
  * **Composition finding:** the FULL menu @3.5 bpp/0.6B allocates **all-CB**
    (196 Linears across NVFP4_CB_K18..K24 + FP8_CB_K36..K48, **zero stock**) —
    FP8_CB Pareto-dominates stock NVFP4/FP8_DYNAMIC at this scale (exp1c). A
    stock-favoring menu (drop FP8_CB) @3.5 bpp gives a real allocation with
    **FP8_E4M3×36 + NVFP4×1**, which exported CLEAN on the real 0.6B: NVFP4 quad
    (weight_packed/weight_scale/weight_global_scale/input_global_scale), FP8
    pair (weight/weight_scale), 8-tensor `.pqcb`, 0 codebooks in model.safetensors.
  * **Tests:** 10 new (stock round-trips bit-exact vs the CT codec; mixed
    config_groups schema; fused global-scale share; `.pqcb` sidecar contract);
    full CB suite green (162). One owner-test line authorized (`nv_fp`→`MXFP4`,
    now a correctly-accepted NVFP4 alias) + 2 codebook-read lines updated to the
    `.pqcb` (mechanical consequence of the sidecar move).
  * **REMAINING serving-agent territory (task-2b vLLM smoke deferred behind
    both):** (a) plugin stock-CT delegation — was stubbed, now being
    implemented concurrently (config.py + test_delegation.py); (b) config.json
    `config_groups` **inlining** — plugin `from_config` needs them inlined, the
    exporter still writes a `config_file` pointer (the "serve export driver"
    step, out of the codebook scope). `scripts/smoke_nvfp4_cb_delegation.sh`
    carries the export + vLLM load/generate, marked blocked on (a)/(b).
- **DELEGATION LIVE (018f72a):** mixed serve smoke tally 98 CB + 14 stock-CT +
  1 unquantized = composition-exact; lazy config resolution fixed (pointer-
  style configs, production-critical); degraded generation differentially
  attributed to v1-fp4-at-low-bpw, NOT delegation. All 27B gates GREEN.
- **27B PRODUCTION RUN DISPATCHED** (menu agent, end-to-end): Qwen3.6-27B
  @5.5bpp, menu = stock NVFP4/FP8/BF16 + FP8_CB_K36-K48 (fp4-CB deliberately
  excluded: irrelevant at 5.5bpp + needs plugin v2-compose). Gold-metric A/B
  vs downloaded rdtand/Qwen3.6-27B-PrismaAURA-5.5bit, same BF16 session;
  + 27B speed table (no-prefill-degradation proof at scale); honesty reqs
  (matched-bpp accounting, menu+cost bundling caveat) in the dispatch.
  Research A/B — NO HF publishing.
- **Plugin v2-compose DISPATCHED in parallel** (serving agent): two-tier fp4
  serving (in-kernel scale compose per spec §4, both prefill paths, v1/v2
  dispatch) — the Hy3/DSv4 ultra-low-bpp lane prerequisite.
- **27B PRODUCTION RUN — UNDERWAY (menu agent, overnight).** Qwen3.6-27B
  (/home/rob/.cache/huggingface/qwen36-27b-bf16, dense hidden=5120 x64 layers +
  vision encoder → text-only calib) through EXPORT_CONTAINER=nvfp4_cb @5.5 bpp,
  menu = NVFP4,FP8_DYNAMIC,BF16,FP8_CB_K36..K48 (no fp4-CB). Drivers committed:
  scripts/run_27b_prod_nvfp4cb.sh (pipeline) + scripts/measure_27b_ab.sh
  (gold-metric A/B). WORK_DIR=/home/rob/dq-runs/prod-27b-nvfp4cb-5p5;
  console=/home/rob/dq-runs/prod_27b_console.log (nohup, deadman-monitored).
  * **OOM finding (deadman-caught):** the dispatch's 32x1024 probe OOM-kills on
    128 GB unified (per-layer act x64 + 47 GB weight cache spike at the phase-1
    ->phase-3 transition). Forced to 8x1024 (8192 tok, 2x the shipped 27B's
    8x512, CACHE_HEADROOM_GB=45) — fits at vmhwm 16.5 GB. Documented as a
    box-forced deviation for prod_27b_results.md.
  * codebook-source=lattice (lockstep-exact with the COST_MODE=local registry
    qdq). PrismaAURA-5.5 downloaded (23G, /home/rob/dq-runs/prod-27b-aura-dl).
  * NEXT (when export completes): (1) footprint verify (nvfp4_cb_footprint,
    body bpp ~5.5, incl. .pqcb sidecars); (2) bash scripts/measure_27b_ab.sh
    (OURS vs PrismaAURA-5.5 vs BF16, same session, conf-KL/all-KL/top1/PPL +
    3x TTFT/decode); (3) write docs/nvfp4-cb-plan/prod_27b_results.md with the
    verdict table + honesty caveats (matched-bpp, menu+cost bundling vs the
    shipped aura-cost/validated recipe, single-seed KL, 8x1024-not-32x1024).
- **All four goal fronts now active simultaneously:** (1) 27B production A/B
  mid-cost-stage (verdict ~4-7h); (2) 35B MoE prep dispatched (packed-expert
  CB chain + expert-uniform tests + route-flip/empirical-cost design note);
  (3) Hy3 source re-download running in background (557GB, front-running the
  ultra-low-bpp milestone; pid + redownload.log deadman-able); (4) CUTLASS
  foundations queued to the kernel owner post-v2-compose (sm_121 disassembly
  recon + buildable CUTLASS skeleton + kernel priority order; full build
  gated on the 27B verdict per Robert's amendment).
- **Fifth + sixth fronts opened (goal-hook driven):** M4-hybrid empirical
  expert cost implementation dispatched (formats agent, per its own
  moe_cb_design spec — the last 35B critical-path code); DSv4-Flash CB-lane
  readiness audit dispatched (new worker: fp8-source ingestion, 671B streaming,
  profile/serving gaps, ultra-low-bpp menu design → dsv4_readiness.md).
  35B MoE prep VERIFIED (167 tests green on HEAD).
- **DSv4 AUDIT LANDED (c9a2c1b): NOT attemptable today — 9 gaps, ~900-1500 LoC,
  dependency-ordered** (fp8-source ingestion invisible to the exporter; export
  loads 295GB resident = OOM; no per-expert stacking/remap in the CB exporter;
  plugin dense-only; TP-sharding of packed superblocks unproven; FP8_SOURCE
  MISSING from the CB menu — real hole for fp8-native models). Queue effects:
  serving agent reordered (plugin MoE method BEFORE CUTLASS foundations — it
  blocks both 35B and DSv4); FP8_SOURCE menu fix queued to formats agent after
  M4-hybrid. DSv4 source download deferred (disk: Hy3 has priority; no
  co-download under the 10% rule).
- **27B COST STALL ROOT-CAUSED (2026-07-17): CONTENTION, not a code bug.**
  Shard 4 "wedged" 112min = CPU/IO starvation from 5+ concurrent heavy agents
  (MoE/DSv4/M4/FP8_SOURCE) + 557GB Hy3 download hammering the 20-core box during
  the launch-bound CB cost loop. Verified: shard_000.pkl has REAL FP8_CB costs
  (all 4 rungs × 55 Linears) — path works; shards 0-3 finished while box quiet.
  GPU healthy (fresh matmul 0.24s, kill didn't wedge it). Killed the stalled run
  (exact PID), resumable from cost_shard_003.pkl. Hybrid model note: Qwen3.6-27B
  is DeltaNet-hybrid (linear_attn in_proj_qkv/a/b/z + mlp; prefix
  model.language_model.layers.N). LESSON → memory feedback_no_overparallel.
  RECOVERY: resume cost from shard 4 as SOLE heavy job (fleet paused); if it
  flies quiet, contention confirmed; deadman needs fixing (didn't fire @112min).
- FP8_SOURCE menu (026e1a0) + M4-hybrid (6b0a2f6) landed green (1170).
- **27B stall FULLY DIAGNOSED + relaunched clean (2026-07-17 late):** confirmed
  contention (~12× slowdown; 130min/7-layer-shard contended vs a few min/shard
  quiet; full quiet re-walk ~1-2h). Two coordination RACES occurred (Fable
  launched → menu agent killed it mid-investigation → relaunch). RESOLVED:
  Fable is SOLE process-lifecycle owner; menu agent stripped of ALL kill
  authority (read-only monitor + report-to-Fable + downstream A/B only). Bad
  LAYERS_PER_SHARD=7 edit reverted (auto 2-layer re-walk is correct/fast).
  Pipeline running (relaunch2). LESSON extended: in multi-agent orchestration,
  exactly ONE owner may kill/launch a shared long-running process; monitors are
  read-only. Folded into feedback_no_overparallel_during_prod semantics.
- **CONTENTION DIAGNOSIS RETRACTED — it's a REAL ENCODE PERF BUG (2026-07-17):**
  shard-write timestamps 14:09/16:19/18:29/20:39 = gaps 7796/7797/7790s =
  **130min ± 3s dead-constant across varying fleet load** → deterministic
  single-threaded/launch-bound, NOT contention (contention = variable gaps).
  Profiled: one 89M-elem 27B MLP encode (weighted, balanced tier) = **76.7s**,
  dominated by _stream_moments (5616 calls, 79.9s cum) — the moment scale-score
  launches ~5600 tiny GPU kernels, launch-bound. Fast on 0.6B (small chunk×cand
  count → why encode_tiers.md looked fine), catastrophic on 27B's big MLPs =
  SCALING bug. ~19h cost stage. My earlier "contention/my over-parallel fault"
  was WRONG (over-parallel was still bad practice but not the cause). Doomed
  27B run STOPPED. Fix dispatched to formats agent (batch moment scoring across
  chunk×candidate dims — the efficiency-wave lever, now proven mandatory);
  target 76.7s→few-sec; 27B restarts on the fixed encode. Directly the goal's
  fast-quant priority.
- **ENCODE BUG FIXED (b9ca9e6) + 27B RESTARTED CLEAN on fixed encode:**
  balanced 76.7s→21.9s/Linear (×3.5); cost stage ~19h→~5.4h. Root cause
  (agent-corrected, twice-corrected diagnosis): VOLUME-bound — moment matrices
  rebuilt ~4× + sequential greedy hill. Fix: build-once moments + exhaustive
  batched scale grid (STRICT SUPERSET of greedy reach → provably no-worse
  choices on real weights, bit-identical on the 89M Linear; max tier stays
  bit-identical anchor). Verified: 21.3s encode, superset argument sound, CB
  suite 147 green. Honesty-flag reviewed+accepted: a v2-vs-v1 synthetic test
  loosened to 0.2% (off the critical v1 27B path; v2 opt-in). GPU now 78W (real
  work) vs old 47W (launch-bound) — fix confirmed in-pipeline. Cleared stale
  mixed-shard cost pkls (probe preserved), rebuilding clean. relaunch3 live,
  Fable sole owner, menu agent read-only monitor + A/B.
- FOLLOW-UP (goal fast-quant): ~5.4h/27B extrapolates ~2.5d/300B — above "a
  day". Residual is the ~5 (m,K)-pass algorithmic floor at S=14 candidates;
  sub-hour 300B needs a custom Triton reduction kernel OR RD-law ladder-interp
  (predict_cb_ladder_costs, validated ±3%, opt-in) to price fewer rungs. Next
  optimization wave, not blocking the 27B verdict.
- **27B cost+alloc DONE (~5h clean), EXPORT crashed on a real bug:** exporter
  skeleton lookup used canonical qname (model.layers.N) but hybrid Qwen3.6
  skeleton uses NESTED model.language_model.layers.N — every skeleton read
  misses. Cost.pkl + layer_config + pareto all CACHED/valid (only export redoes).
  Fix dispatched to menu agent (profile-based nested-prefix name resolver;
  affects Hy3/DSv4 too) → re-export (~30-45min) → A/B. Sole-owner rule lifted
  for this final sequential export→A/B (no concurrent process to race).
- **Goal-progress while 27B re-exports (fleet-discipline respected — 1 low-
  contention CODE task, no GPU/full-suite):** streaming CB exporter dispatched
  (formats agent) — the 200-300B milestone's #1 prerequisite (DSv4 audit gap 2:
  in-memory export OOMs at 295-557GB). New sibling export_nvfp4_cb_streaming.py
  mirroring export_gguf_direct's _ShardIndex lazy-load; bf16-source (Hy3, on
  disk) first, fp8-source (DSv4) branch flagged; MoE expert streaming; byte-
  identical-to-in-memory correctness pin. Unblocks Hy3/DSv4 export; GPU build
  waits for the box. 35B build + Hy3/DSv4 builds remain GPU-gated behind the
  27B verdict (imminent) — correct sequencing, not idle.
- **35B launch-readiness CONFIRMED (CPU check, non-contending):** source
  Qwen3.5-35B-A3B on disk; detect_profile → Qwen3_5Profile (MoE,
  Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration, has_mtp); FP8_CB rungs registered; CB
  serving profile present. Build GPU-gated behind the 27B verdict (single-box).
  MoE-specifics for the build (which 35B base to match the shipped
  PrismaAURA-4.75 comparison, COST_MODE=aura+expert_empirical M4-hybrid for
  route-flip-correct expert costs, DeltaNet --max-num-batched-tokens≥2096, MTP
  serve handling) → menu agent finalizes post-27B-verdict.
- **HONEST GOAL STATE (single-GPU physical constraint):** all CODE prereqs for
  all 3 model classes DONE. Served proofs are sequential GPU builds (hours each)
  on ONE box: 27B (verdict imminent) → 35B (ready) → Hy3 (streaming exporter
  ready, source on disk) → DSv4 (audited, source not on disk, 9 gaps). Not
  idleness — correct sequencing; parallel builds would re-starve the critical
  run (feedback_no_overparallel_during_prod). Each build launches informed by
  the prior verdict.
- **A/B input de-risked (non-contending catch):** the PrismaAURA-5.5 comparison
  baseline was NOT on disk (only refs/main 12K — the menu agent's "downloaded"
  never landed the weights). Would have failed the A/B at serve time.
  Downloading the real ~23GB now (bg, HF cache; 27B export unaffected at 74W —
  network IO ≠ GPU starvation). Menu agent told to read-verify DL completion
  before serving. All other A/B inputs present (wiki.test.raw, BF16 ref,
  measure_27b_ab.sh, 293GB free). 27B re-export healthy (pid 1452, ~24min in).
- **35B build FULLY launch-staged (non-contending):** driver committed
  (run_35b_prod_nvfp4cb.sh; M4-hybrid route-flip wiring verified complete —
  run-pipeline CB_EXPERT_EMPIRICAL=1 auto-merges empirical expert unit-KL);
  Ornith-1.0-35B base (~70GB) NOW DOWNLOADING (was absent) so the 35B served
  proof launches the instant the 27B frees the GPU + verdict reviewed. 27B
  export verified healthy throughout (R-state, 26GB GPU, materializing output);
  network IO for the download does NOT starve it (79W sustained).
- HONEST GOAL STATE: 27B verdict ~2-3h (export ~1-2h encode + ~1h A/B); 35B
  launch-staged behind it; Hy3 streaming-ready (source on disk); DSv4 audited.
  Served proofs are physically GPU-sequential — advancing by pre-staging every
  non-GPU prerequisite, not by parallel builds (which would re-starve the 27B).
- **AUTONOMOUS BUILD CHAIN armed (overnight throughput):** menu agent = sequential-
  build orchestrator: 27B A/B+verdict → auto-launch 35B (run_35b_prod_nvfp4cb.sh,
  base at ornith-35b-base) with EARLY sanity-gate (probe+first-cost-shard read-check;
  stop+report if OOM/crash/empty-costs/expert-empirical-error, don't grind 6h broken)
  → 35B A/B+verdict → report both. Hy3 GATED (fp4-CB serving needs v2-compose
  validation). Gets 2 of 3 classes served overnight autonomously; each verdict
  reported for my review. One heavy job at a time (fleet-discipline holds).
