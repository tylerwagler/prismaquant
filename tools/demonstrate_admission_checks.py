"""Demonstrate that each admission check actually fails when it is broken.

Not a test and not collected as one: this is the evidence behind "a check that
cannot fail is not a check". For each guard in `admit_fixed_resources` it
edits that guard out of the source, runs the tests that claim to cover it, and
requires them to FAIL. A guard whose removal leaves its tests green would be a
vacuous check and is reported as such.

Run it under PrismaBuild like any other test execution, from the repository
root: `pbrun.py --cwd <checkout> --cpus 2 --demand mem_gb=4 --priority -10
--tag dl380g10 -- <interpreter> tools/demonstrate_admission_checks.py`. It
mutates only the snapshot it runs in and restores the file after every case,
including on failure.
