"""Zero-churn check: does the Sensitivity Card price like the shipping allocator?

The adoption argument for the card rests on a claim that must be checked against
*real* production artifacts, not synthetic fixtures: pricing a (unit, format)
through the card's SCALAR tier returns bit-for-bit what
`allocator_solver.predicted_dloss` returns for the same run. If that holds, a
pipeline switched to the card allocates identically -- no churn, no re-validation
of shipped artifacts.

It is a tool rather than a test because it needs a real WORK_DIR: a `probe.pkl`
and the `cost.pkl` produced from it. Run it against any completed run.

    python3 tools/validate_card_zero_churn.py --artifacts WORK/artifacts

Measured 2026-08-14 on `prod-27b-nvfp4cb-5p5` (Qwen3.6-27B, 505 units, the
NVFP4-CB menu): 3528/3528 (unit, format) pairs bit-identical, 3024 of them with
a nonzero predicted loss.

Note on scope: this validates the SCALAR tier, which is the tier that must not
change answers. MARGINAL and AQUA are *new* estimators -- they are supposed to
differ, and they are screening surrogates with no served A/B.
