"""Serve fingerprint — mechanize the §7.4 reproducibility contract.

R15 (`docs/audits/architecture_re-vet_2026-07-30.md`). KL is bit-identical
*within* one docker session and drifts 4-8x *across* sessions: loading any CUDA
extension into the serving process shifts allocator addresses, activations get
different pointer alignments, and alignment-sensitive cuBLAS/CUTLASS heuristics
pick different kernels. On the 27B this reads as two bit-reproducible states,
conf-KL 0.01134 vs 0.01328 (+-17%), keyed purely on whether one lane's CUDA
`.so` was resident during the dump. That measurement was taken on the
Gridbook lane, retired 2026-09-02 (archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/), but the
mechanism is the loader's and not the lane's. The rule ("A/B arms must have
identical extension residency; deltas under ~+-20% across differing stacks are
not evidence") was prose with nothing enforcing it.

This module makes the stack an object:

* `collect_manifest()` reads the **server's** address space
  (`/proc/<pid>/maps`) - it must be server-side, because the measuring client
  cannot see the server's residency, which is exactly why the drift stayed
  invisible for so long.
* `fingerprint()` = sha256 of the canonical JSON of the manifest **minus argv
  paths**, so two artifacts served the same way share a fingerprint (an A/B
  needs that) while a changed image / extension set / eager flag does not.
* `native_extension_status` records, per pinned native-extension row, whether
  the scan found the library plus the row's `when_unavailable` block, so a
  §7.4 refusal can name the substitute decoder a serve without the library
  ran on (PrismaQuant #142). It is a deterministic projection of
  `resident_extensions` and is excluded from both fingerprints, so manifests
  written before it compare unchanged.

CLI (run inside the serving container, after READY):

    python3 -P /repo/tools/prismaquant_source_bootstrap.py \
        run-tool serve-fingerprint write \
        --out /dqruns/<run>/exported/serve_manifest.json --image vllm-node:latest

Stdlib only by construction: it must not import torch or vllm into the serving
container (an extra CUDA context on a 121 GiB unified pool is how boxes die),
so versions come from `importlib.metadata` and the GPU from NVML via
`nvidia-smi`.

# archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/.
#
# The list is defined below, after the Tessera pin read: its third member is
# the serving runtime's own residency knob, whose NAME comes from the pin
# rather than being typed here.  It holds two kinds of names, and the comment
# on each member says which: names whose ABSENCE is the proof (the serving
# process must resolve its imports from the installed distribution rather
# than a working-directory shadow), and the one name whose VALUE is recorded
# (two serves of one artifact in different residency modes must not share a
# performance-stack fingerprint).

#: Extensions whose residency moves the numbers (§7.4) and that are matched by
#: a SUBSTRING of the mapped path.
# The Gridbook `.so` was named here until that lane retired 2026-09-02
# (archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/). A lane whose kernels are not matched
# here fingerprints as "nothing resident", so any new serving lane must be
# matched -- but a lane whose runtime PUBLISHES how to match its libraries
# belongs in `TESSERA_NATIVE_EXTENSIONS` below and not in this alternation:
# a substring search is this file's own predicate, and only the runtime's is
# the runtime's.
# `fla` is matched by its installed package DIRECTORY (`/fla/`), never by the
# bare three letters: a free `fla` alternative matches any path containing
# those letters (`libflac.so`, `conflate`), which made `flashinfer` redundant
# and could false-refuse a comparable A/B when the spurious library is
# resident in exactly one arm.

#: The rule name a published table uses to say "fnmatch the glob against the
#: BASENAME of a mapped `.so`".  Tessera's contract publishes it as a value
#: (`native_extensions[].match`) rather than as prose, precisely because a
#: consumer cannot otherwise tell a stem from a prefix from a pattern.
MATCH_BASENAME_FNMATCH = "basename_fnmatch"

#: The CUDA extensions the pinned Tessera release's plugin loads into a
#: serving process, and HOW to recognise them.
#
# These rows belong to the pinned Tessera RUNTIME CONTRACT, not to this file's
# judgement and not to a hand-written pin: since Tessera contract v7 the
# plugin publishes `native_extensions`, and each row's `module_name_prefix` is
# the very constant its JIT load path passes to `cpp_extension.load`. There is
# no exact basename to name -- the module name carries a build-identity hash,
# so the library on disk is `tessera_nvfp4_<identity>.so` -- which is why the
# table publishes a glob plus the `match` rule to apply it with.
#
# The chain is contract -> pin -> here, with a refusal at each link. This
# module is stdlib-only by construction (it runs inside the serving container
# from a bootstrapped snapshot that ships the tool files plus the pin JSON,
# and no installed PrismaQuant package), so it cannot import the contract
# reader or the pin reader module -- but it does not need to: the pin is a
# JSON file, and `_load_tessera_native_extensions_from_pin` reads the
# transported copy beside this tool and REFUSES a missing or malformed one.
# There is no constant to fall back to, because a fallback would restore the
# silent hole with a field to point at: a serving container running a snapshot
# of this tool from an older commit, beside a newer Tessera whose extension
# has been renamed, must refuse rather than fingerprint "no lane extension
# resident". The pin JSON travels with the tool because it is a member of
# `_GOLD_PRODUCER_COMMON_FILES`, so the transported snapshot is
# digest-covered for the bytes this predicate decides on;
# `tessera_runtime_contract.require_pin_native_extensions_match_contract`
# refuses a pin that is not the contract's table, and
# `tests/test_tessera_serve_fingerprint.py` refuses a tool that does not read
# the pin -- and refuses this file's predicate if it stops agreeing with the
# rule the contract names.
#
# Until 2026-09-03 no Tessera name was matched at all, so a serve running
# Tessera's own native span-2 decode fingerprinted identically to a stock
# serve and §7.4's "identical extension residency" rule could not see the one
# lane whose whole point is a custom decoder. Then it was matched by
# `re.escape("tessera_nvfp4")` anywhere in the mapped path -- a predicate that
# is not the runtime's, and that answers yes for
# `/root/.cache/torch_extensions/tessera_nvfp4_9f2c/unrelated.so`. Then the
# rows were carried here as a constant, refused only by the test suite on the
# tree the snapshot came from -- which is the hole this read closes.
#
# Since PrismaQuant #142 each row also carries the contract's
# `when_unavailable` block -- per residency mode, the substitute decoder a
# serve keeps running on when this library is absent, or that there is no
# serve at all. The manifest's `native_extension_status` projects these rows
# against what the scan found, so a §7.4 refusal names the substitute instead
# of implying a drift band. The block arrives through the pin read above,
# refused missing or malformed like the other three members, because a
# constant here would be a transcription no container-side refusal keeps
# honest; `tests/test_tessera_substitute_decoder.py` refuses a carried block
# that is not the pin's.

#: The pin file as seen from this tool, in a developer checkout and in the
#: transported container snapshot alike: the snapshot root is this file's
#: canonical parent, and the pin is tracked versioned data under it.
