"""Fan a Tessera anchor campaign out across the fleet, one row per anchor group.

``prismaquant.tessera_campaign`` prices a rate surface per (unit, family), and
every one of those surfaces is independent work: its anchors, its
leave-one-out gate and its refusal are its own.  Run as one process it is a
single exclusive GPU action, and the second box sits idle beside it
(RobTand/prismaquant#282).  This lays the same campaign out as N PrismaBuild
rows and puts the pieces back together.

The quantum is the **fused anchor group**, not the bare unit.  Anchors are
placed per group: the group shares one rung grid, and the group's worst member
drives every split (``tessera_campaign`` round loop).  A group is therefore the
smallest scope whose measured values do not depend on what else the run priced,
which is what makes the merged table equal to the monolith's rather than merely
similar to it.

Four steps, and each one is separately re-runnable:

``census``
    One cheap GPU row: a calibration forward over the whole scope that counts
    each unit's rows and reports the anchor grouping.  The counts are what let
    every later row stamp the **scope's** ``fit_tokens`` rather than its own
    selection's, so the sharded table carries one Hessian identity -- the same
    one a whole-scope run carries.  The grouping is what lets ``plan`` lay out
    rows without loading the model.

``plan``
    One ``--units`` selection file per row and one pbcampaign manifest.  Rows
    are portable (no host pin), not exclusive, GPU-demanding, and carry a
    memory demand derived from the phase plan the row will check itself
    against -- the plan's bytes, the process floor measured on this fleet, and
    the margin the row's own guard holds back from its cap.

``check``
    The same derivation, run against a manifest that already exists, refusing
    any row whose declared ``demand.mem_gb`` is below it or whose derived
    demand is wider than a GPU box.  ``submit`` runs it first, so a row is
    never queued for an admission that its own guard will decline
    (RobTand/prismaquant#522).

``submit``
    ``pbcampaign`` over that manifest.  Re-running it **is** the resume: a
    finished row is a CAS hit that runs nothing and a running row is attached
    to by its job id, so there is no second dispatcher here deciding what to
    skip.

``merge``
    One ``cost.pkl``, one ``cost.anchors.json`` and one export-inputs cache
    from the rows, refusing on any identity the rows do not already share.  The
    merged Hessian capture is the union of the rows' -- the same H under the
    same counts and the same provenance a whole-scope run writes -- so its
    digest is recomputed rather than asserted, and every row's
    ``capture_sha256`` is re-stamped to it.

Seeding from a campaign already in flight
-----------------------------------------
``--seed-checkpoint`` on a planned row hands the monolith's stored anchors to
that row's own gates: the producer input identity is recomputed from the row's
weights, menu, Hessian and static scale, and the cached wire is re-verified
against it, so a seeded row adopts only bytes it would itself have encoded.
The adaptive state needs nothing else -- ``grid``, the leave-one-out error and
the stop reason are all recomputed from the anchor set at the top of every
round -- so adopting the anchors resumes the group exactly where it stood.

Rows planned before the progress contract
-----------------------------------------
Nothing migrates in place.  A row already in ``ready/`` was sealed with its
own ``execution_timeout_s``; that request is immutable and stays exactly as
it is, still bounded by the number it was submitted with.  The stall policy
is sealed too, so a plan made after it produces different action keys, and a
key that has never been priced is not a cache hit.  What carries the work
across is the journal rather than the queue: the new row resumes from the
same identity-bound ``cost_stage_checkpoint`` directory (or is handed the
monolith's anchors with ``--seed-workspace`` / ``--seed-checkpoint``), so the
anchors already committed under the old key are re-adopted rather than
re-measured.  Withdraw the old rows once the new ones are running; do not
edit them.

    * the checkpoint, which is loaded whole in ``bfloat16`` and is the same for

    * the selection's Hessians, ``in x in`` in fp32 per member, which is the
      accumulator ``_collect_activations`` keeps;
    * the selection's retained scoring rows, ``max_act_rows x in`` in fp32.

    plus the spec's declared headroom for the forward pass and the encoder.

    **The spec's process baseline is charged here, once, outside the deltas.**
    A phase plan states deltas, and the floor those deltas sit on --
    interpreter, torch, the CUDA runtime, the pages the row's process has
    touched -- is a property of the box the row lands on, which this planner
    never enters. So it is still never derived here; it is *reserved*. A spec
    that declares ``process_baseline_bytes`` owns the number, including a
    declared zero; a spec that declares nothing gets
    ``DEFAULT_PROCESS_BASELINE_BYTES``, the worst floor measured on this fleet.
    ``baseline_policy`` records which of the two a plan used. Either way the
    scope travels with the number: it is this fleet's or this recipe's
    reservation, not a universal maximum.

    It is added to the demand and never to ``memory_bytes``, because the
    demand becomes a cgroup cap of exactly that many GiB
    (``prismabuild/pool.py:2850``) while the row refuses unless its plan fits
    under that cap *less* the floor it measures for itself
    (``prismaquant/tessera_campaign.py:4515``). Fold the reservation into the
    plan instead and the predicate compares an inflated delta against an
    inflated cap and nets to zero -- which is exactly why the spec's declared
    headroom, a term inside ``memory_bytes``, could never close this gap.

    Both branches charge it. A process floor exists whether or not a row
    streams, so leaving the resident-source branch out would make the key mean
    one thing on one path and nothing on the other.

    Rounding is not a reservation. ``ceil`` leaves at most one GiB of slack,
    and the floor on the #390 receipt is 1,062,359,040 bytes -- 0.9894 GiB,
    less than the most ``ceil`` can leave -- so before this key a row admitted
    according to where its ``memory_bytes`` landed modulo one GiB, which both
    inspected example rows lost. The row
    still measures its own floor at its first ``CaptureMemoryGuard.check`` and
    stamps it on its receipt (RobTand/prismaquant#390); that reading, not this
    declaration, remains the measured number.

    **The guard's own margin is charged here too.** The row is refused not at
    its cap but at ``cap - margin``: ``CaptureMemoryGuard.check`` compares its
    absolute reading against ``cap_bytes - margin_bytes``
    (``prismaquant/memory_management.py``). A demand that covers the plan and
    the floor but not the margin therefore buys an admission the row's own
    first check declines. The number is read from the guard, never restated,
    so the two cannot drift apart.

#: The quiet a pricing row is allowed in each phase, in the order it walks
#: them. Chosen with margin from a least-squares fit of ``elapsed_s`` against
#: committed batches over the 23 completed 864-unit GLM pricing rows in the
#: fleet's terminal records (2026-09-10) gives 18.6728 s of wall clock per
#: committed batch and an 836.1 s non-pricing intercept; the greatest absolute
#: residual is 160.5 s. The retained-record extraction and its exact row and
#: terminal hashes are committed in ``docs/measurements/pq480_progress_grace_fit_2026-09-10.md``.
#:
#: So: ``pricing`` permits 48.2 fitted commit intervals, and ``startup`` and
#: ``finalize`` each exceed the fitted non-pricing interval including its
#: greatest residual (996.6 s). The sum, 6300 s, is the longest a row can
#: run having committed nothing -- less than half the 14,400 s that killed
#: row-0050 and row-0065 while they were committing anchors every 18 s.
#:
#: There is no flag to override this, on purpose: the number is a measurement
#: of one workload and a flag would invite a guess.  A campaign whose rows
#: measurably behave differently edits its planned manifest -- ``plan`` writes
#: ``progress_phases`` into every row and ``submit`` reads it back -- or
#: re-fits this constant against its own terminal records.
