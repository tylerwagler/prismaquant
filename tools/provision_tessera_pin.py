"""Install the Tessera the pin names into an interpreter, and check the bytes.

GitHub CI checks out ``RobTand/tessera`` at the commit
``tools/resolve_tessera_dev_pin.py`` prints and runs
``pip install --no-deps`` on that directory.  Nothing did the same for the
fleet interpreters, so ``/home/rob/venvs/pq-cpu312`` sat on a Tessera from an
ancestor of the pin: answer-equivalent, different bytes, and every
byte-identity assertion red in PrismaBuild while green in CI (issue #455).

This is that missing step, written so a re-pin can carry it.  A re-pin is
already a reviewed change to the pin JSON and the module constants together;
run this on the same change and the fleet moves with them instead of behind
them.

The pin is read the way the resolver reads it -- parsed out of
``prismaquant/tessera_runtime_contract.py`` -- so this tool imports neither
PrismaQuant nor Tessera and runs on an interpreter that has neither.

**The pin names a commit, and the check has to be the commit.**  An earlier
version of this tool compared the packaged ``runtime_contract.json`` alone and
stopped there.  That file is one file in the commit's tree, and two commits can
publish identical contract bytes while differing everywhere else -- tessera#437
rewrites the window encoder and leaves the contract untouched -- so a
contract-only gate reports "already the reviewed bytes" for a re-pin whose
entire content is new encoder code, and leaves the old encoder installed.  What
is compared now is a digest over the installed ``tessera`` package's own files
as well, taken under ``-I`` so it is the installed distribution answering and
not a checkout that happens to be on ``PYTHONPATH``.  The version string is no
check at all: the pin's version is static ``0.1.0`` and so was the stale
install's.

Usage::

    python tools/provision_tessera_pin.py --python /home/rob/venvs/pq-cpu312/bin/python

By default the source is materialised under ``/mnt/shared/tessera-pins/<commit>``
from a local Tessera clone.  That directory is a cache and not a
content-addressed store, whatever its name suggests: an interrupted ``tar``
leaves one with the right name and some of the right files.  So each tree is
written beside a manifest of its own digest, published with an atomic
``os.replace``, and reused only while it still digests to what the manifest
says.  A tree with no manifest is not assumed wrong: it is compared against a
fresh ``git archive`` and, when the bytes are the commit's, attested where it
stands.  Only a tree that neither holds its manifest nor matches the archive is
replaced, and the old one is kept.  Both of those paths need the clone.

    * **No manifest, right bytes.**  A tree written before this tool existed,
      or by a run that died after extracting and before attesting, is not
      assumed wrong.  Its content is compared against a fresh ``git archive``
      of the commit and, when equal, the manifest is written beside it.  The
      bytes are not replaced: rewriting a shared directory other boxes may be
      reading, to end with what is already there, is churn with a window in it.
    * **Anything else.** The tree is moved aside under a
      ``.quarantine-<commit>-...`` name and the fresh archive published in its
      place.  It is not deleted.  Something wrote to a shared pins root and
      those bytes are the only record of what; the quarantine path is returned
      in ``report`` so a run says where it went.

    **The repair path is not an atomic exchange, and needs a quiescent
    reader.**  A first publication is one ``os.replace`` onto a name that does
    not exist yet, so a reader sees nothing or the whole tree.  Replacing a
    wrong tree is two: the old name is vacated, then the new tree takes it.
    Between them the path is *absent*, and a reader opening it then gets
    ``FileNotFoundError`` rather than either version.  The manifest is written
    on the staged tree first, so a failure while hashing or attesting the
    replacement leaves the old tree still in place and the window unopened;
    once the quarantine rename has run the window is open until the second
    rename lands.  It is short and it is not zero.  Run a repair when nothing
    is serving out of that path, and read ``report["quarantined"]`` for where
    the predecessor went.

    Staging is ``mkdtemp`` under the pins root -- unique and owned, where the
    earlier PID-named scratch could collide between hosts on NFS and was
