"""Publish an exported artifact to the Hub through the blocking ship gate.

Model publication is deliberately stricter than a convenience ``hf upload``:

* the artifact's canonical ``shipcard.json`` must be a readable, regular,
  non-symlink file (this structural rule is not force-overrideable);
* the complete local file set is frozen before the authoritative shipcard
  replay. Small files are captured as bytes. Large files stay zero-copy, but
  are held by no-follow file descriptors and content-addressed blockwise; the
  upload reader refuses to expose a block that differs from that snapshot;
* the remote file set is enumerated at one exact branch head and replaced in
  one ``create_commit`` call with ``revision`` plus ``parent_commit`` CAS.
  ``.gitattributes`` is the one intentional retained Hub-managed file;
* model artifacts publish only at repository root and never through include or
  exclude filters.

``--force-unverified`` overrides failed quality/evidence slots only. It still
requires a valid canonical card, requires the artifact basename to be retyped,
and stamps the override into the bytes that are frozen and uploaded.

There is intentionally no raw ``hf upload`` fallback: that command cannot
preserve this frozen-byte and remote-CAS contract. If ``huggingface_hub`` is not
available, install it and rerun this publisher from the beginning.

Exit codes: 0 published (or local dry-run complete) · 1 refused/runtime failure
· 2 usage/structural error.
