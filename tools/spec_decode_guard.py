"""Spec-decode refusal for the gold lane.

`validate_quantized_model.py` has scraped `/metrics` for `vllm:spec_decode` and
refused to return a verdict since the draft-logprobs postmortem — but that guard
lived *only* there. The gold lane (`tools/measure_vllm_full_kl.py`,
`tools/measure_vllm_wikitext_ppl.py`), which is metric authority rung 1, had no
such guard at all (R13).

The gold tools construct their own in-process `LLM`, so the detection is the
engine's own config rather than a Prometheus scrape; both forms live here so the
refusal text and semantics stay identical.

Returned/recorded `spec_decode_detected`:

* `False` — inspected and spec-decode is off (the only state the shipcard accepts
  on a `gold.*` record)
* `True`  — refuse: vLLM routes echo/prompt logprobs through the DRAFT model, so
  the NLL/KL would be the 1-layer MTP head's, not the artifact's
* `None`  — could not inspect. Not treated as "off": `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli verify`
  refuses an unknown, because an unverified negative is what the original trap
  looked like.
