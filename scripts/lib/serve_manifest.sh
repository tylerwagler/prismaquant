# serve_manifest.sh — shared helper: write the R15 serve fingerprint.
#
# Every gold-lane number is only comparable to another taken on the SAME
# serving stack: loading any CUDA extension shifts allocator addresses, which
# flips alignment-sensitive kernel selection, which moved the same 27B artifact
# between 0.01134 and 0.01328 conf-KL (±17%) on residency alone (§7.4).
#
# The read has to happen INSIDE the container: the measuring client cannot see
# the server's address space, which is exactly why that drift stayed invisible.
# `tools/serve_fingerprint.py` walks the server's /proc/<pid>/maps, records the
# launch argv / image / versions / GPU, and hashes the stack into
# `serve_fingerprint`, which `tools/kl_ab.py` refuses to compare across.
#
# Never fatal: a serve that came up must not be torn down because a JSON could
# not be written. The refusal lives in the comparator, not here.
#
# Usage (after the READY probe):  write_serve_manifest "$NAME" "$MODEL" [image]
#   NAME  = docker container name
#   MODEL = artifact path AS SEEN INSIDE THE CONTAINER (manifest lands beside it)
