"""Locate the Pareto knee, and say what happened to the menu-exhaustion cliff.

HEADLINE OF DELIVERABLE (3). The old-menu curve put the global knee at
103.6 GB / 2.499 bpp -- far outside the 88-92 GB shave window -- but it also
had a brutal local CLIFF at 88.8-90.2 GB costing 3,891 Delta-loss per GB. That
cliff was not physics: at 88 GB the DP needs 2.055 bpp while the old menu's
cheapest expert rung was NVFP4_CB_K14 at 2.031, so it sat within 1% of its own
floor with nothing left to trade. K12 (1.781) and K13 (1.906) put real headroom
underneath it. This script asks whether that changed the answer.

FRAMES. Bytes and bits are related by an affine map whose intercept is the
immutable floor. Releasing the MTP block translates every chord point equally,
so it cannot change the selected allocation, but it does change the knee's GB
coordinate. The knee is therefore reported in BOTH frames:

    (b) MTP in the floor      GB = floor + reserve + bpp * params/8
    (c) MTP bytes released    same, with floor reduced by 10,862,838,300 B

Comparing them answers a question the grid alone cannot: whether the draft
heads change WHERE the efficient budget is, not merely how much loss it costs.
