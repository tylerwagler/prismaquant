"""Bit-exact pricing: weight_mse == 0.0 short-circuits to zero dloss ONLY
for formats whose activation path is the identity.

Regression #1 (the original motivation): MX re-encodes of QAT/FP8 sources
store the source weights verbatim (``weight_mse == 0.0`` exactly), yet the
cost pipeline records a positive ``output_mse`` for the weight-only
passthrough formats too (kernel dequant dtype noise), which inverted
dominance against lossy k-quants.

Regression #2 (the review catch): the short-circuit must NOT fire for
W·A· formats. ``measure_quant_cost`` applies
``activation_quantize_dequantize(X)`` before computing ``output_mse``, so
for a weight-lossless activation-quantizing format (MXFP4 re-encode of an
MXFP4-packed source, MXFP8_E4M3 of an FP8-block source, ...) that
output_mse is REAL A-side error. Pricing those entries at dloss 0.0 makes
them the unbeatable global minimum at any budget while the served
activations are still quantized.

Contract pinned here:
  - weight-bit-exact + PASSTHROUGH-activation format (act_bits None or >= 16)
    short-circuits to dloss 0.0 ("bit_exact" source);
  - weight-bit-exact + ACTIVATION-QUANTIZING format keeps its measured
    output_mse pricing — at entry, build_candidates, and packed-group
    aggregation level;
  - unknown formats and explicit-cost_source entries never short-circuit;
  - the dtype-level fact used for the gate (FormatSpec.act_quant_changes_input
    <=> a non-identity activation_quantize_dequantize) holds for every
    registered format.
