"""The legal Tessera rate domain, its bytes, and the five support facts.

Every test here checks a *derivation*, not a constant.  The audited counts
1,793 and 3,841, the table-width transitions at R3585 and R3841, and the
singleton native set are compared against what the pinned producer and reader
actually say; none of them is read back out of the module that would have to
be wrong for the check to matter.

The one place a literal is legitimate is the independent byte recomputation:
that test rebuilds a candidate's total from the grammar's own three
quantities -- the body rate, the grid's code width and the table width -- and
refuses to look at the stored total until it has its own.
