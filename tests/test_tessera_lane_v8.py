"""Lane-eligibility schemas v7 and v8: a smoke's CONTROL, and the ENCODER SCOPE.

Tessera's contract v18 (its #195) moved the lane table to
``tessera.lane-eligibility.v7`` and v19 (its #198) to ``v8``. Both are read
here against the INSTALLED contract, never against a fixture this repository
wrote for itself, exactly as ``test_tessera_lane_v6.py`` reads v6.

* v7: ``smoke`` gains ``control`` -- the reference a greedy smoke was compared
  against, ``null`` when nobody ran one -- and ``attribution``, DERIVED from
  the control and checked, exactly as the grade is derived from the KL
  entries. ``shared_with_reference`` says the unquantised source returned the
  same completion; it does not say the route generated correctly.
* v8: ``evidence`` gains ``artifact`` -- ``null`` when no encoder-reproduction
  comparison was recorded, otherwise the historical artifact the cell's KL was
  measured on, the encoder commit that wrote it, and a single-unit re-encode
  screen at a named later commit. It never changes the grade.

What this reader does with the new fields is the subject of the second half:
it parses them closed, refuses by name what it does not understand, carries
them into the refusal text and into route provenance, and does NOT adopt the
consumer rule Tessera's v18 changelog states ("refuses on status 'repetitive'
AND attribution other than 'shared_with_reference'"). On the v20 table that
rule would have ADMITTED the two routed-MoE cells on the strength of a control
alone, which is a promotion decision and not a reader's; prismaquant #198 put
it to Rob and Tessera answered with a measurement: contract v21 (its #313)
re-ran the smoke through the checkpoint's own chat template, both cells read
``status: recorded`` with the control retired (``control: null``,
``attribution: unattributed`` -- the shape the dense cells already used), and
the unchanged status-only rule stops refusing them.

**What these tests therefore do NOT assert is that routed MoE is admitted.**
That verdict is not settled: RobTand/tessera#327 (P1) reports v21's
``recorded`` rests on a repetition rule that lives only in a dated
measurements file, is derived and checked by nothing, and is satisfiable by an
empty completion, so the published status may move again; prismaquant #198
stays open for the promotion either way. The gate tests below assert the
MECHANISM instead -- that the predicate's answer is a function of the status
the pinned table publishes, and that the export gate reads that same answer
rather than forming its own -- which holds under either verdict and fails if
this reader ever starts deciding routed MoE for itself.

Since v21 no installed cell carries a control, so the control GRAMMAR is
exercised here on the installed routed-MoE cells with the v20 control
transplanted back (``_with_v20_control``: the exact block v20 published), and
the refusal text on that same shape. Everything about the installed table is
still read off the installed table.
