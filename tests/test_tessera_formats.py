"""The Tessera grid-space seam, pinned against the rungs that were measured.

The point of this file is not coverage.  ``tessera_formats`` exists to let
PrismaQuant's allocator price Tessera continuously, and two things have to hold
for that to be honest rather than decorative:

1. The rungs with published weight-space numbers must be namable, and must
   price at the bpp those numbers were published at.  An allocator addressing
   rungs nobody measured is addressing fiction.
2. Every rung the module offers must hand the encoder a schedule it will
   accept.  "Continuous" is a claim about realisability, so it is tested by
   realising, not by asserting a range.

# ------------------------------------------------- the recipe is the unit of account
#
# ``tessera.export.wire_recipe`` is the single statement of which body, span,
# scale plane and window the exporter writes for a grid at a rung.  Everything
# below is written against *explicitly constructed* recipes rather than the
# current default, because the default is going to move -- the window body over
# a CHANNEL plane is measured better on E4M3 and is held behind a kernel gate,
# not a doubt -- and a test that only exercises today's wire would go quiet on
# the day the flip happens, which is the day it is needed.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ the sweep
#
# The families are ASKED FOR, not typed. This was a hand-written 3-tuple
# (`("TESSERA_E2M1_K1", "TESSERA_E2M1_K2", "TESSERA_E4M3_K1")`) in the two
# strongest byte-identity proofs in the tree, so the 16-bit family -- live in
# `menu_families()` since the anchor wall became the TCQ body's -- was never
# priced by either, and mis-charging its window table at one byte instead of
# two passed both (#154). `menu_families()` is the roster the DP prices, and it
# grows on a Tessera release without either sweep being edited.
#
# The recipes are two sets unioned: the labelled grammar wires below, which
# deliberately include wires no family writes today because the default moves,
# and each family's OWN resolved wires -- the pattern
# `test_the_hessian_applies_exactly_where_tessera_says_it_does` uses -- so a
# family whose body varies across its rate axis (E2M1x2 is WINDOW below the
# coset cap and TCQ at it) is priced on both.
