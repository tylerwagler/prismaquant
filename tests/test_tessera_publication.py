"""The campaign may publish an anchor's files on another thread, in order.

Every timing assertion here is an ORDERING assertion held open by a barrier
the test controls.  A barrier proves that one thing can begin before another
has finished; it does not measure how much wall clock that is worth on a real
endpoint, and nothing in this file should be read as a speed result.  The
whole-cycle profiles and the both-host power series are collected separately,
on the boxes, against the real arms.
