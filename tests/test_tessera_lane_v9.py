"""Lane-eligibility schema v9: the smoke's RECORD, and who derives from it.

Tessera's contract v22 (its #327) moves the lane table to
``tessera.lane-eligibility.v9``. The change is one nullable key inside
``smoke``::

    "record": null
    "record": {"instrument": ..., "rule": ..., "reference": ...,
               "rows": [{"prompt", "form", "interface", "status",
                         "reference_status"}, ...]}

and it exists because of what #327 found in v21: both ``routed_moe`` cells
published ``smoke.status: "recorded"`` on an aggregation rule that lived only
in a dated measurements file, was derived and checked by nothing, and was
satisfiable by an EMPTY completion. v9 puts the rule and the rows it was
applied to inside the contract, where a consumer can re-derive the status
instead of trusting it.

**What this reader must therefore not do is re-implement that rule.** The
grade is re-derived here (from the KL kinds) and the v7 attribution is
re-derived here (from the control) because both are one-line projections this
repository can state exactly; a repetition rule over completion text is not,
and a second implementation of it is precisely the two-homes defect #327 is
about. So on a v9 table PrismaQuant calls Tessera's own
``derive_smoke_status`` / ``derive_smoke_attribution`` and refuses when the
published value disagrees with what they return, and reads
``EVIDENCE_SMOKE_INTERFACES`` / ``EVIDENCE_SMOKE_FORMS`` from Tessera rather
than typing them beside it.

Delegation tests make Tessera's derivation disagree with the published value
and require the reader to refuse. Differential grammar tests also compare the
real producer validator with this reader on valid and malformed records, so
derivation cannot hide a disagreement about which observations are legal.
