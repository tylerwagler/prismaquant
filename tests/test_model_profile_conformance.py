"""Conformance run of `prismaquant/model_profiles/validate.py` over every
registered ModelProfile.

`validate.py` is a manual CLI with (until this file) zero callers, which is
how the defects it exists to catch survived inside it. This test pins the
CPU-safe part of it plus the invariants that de-vacuum the checks that
short-circuit to green without vLLM.

Lanes:
  - default: pure python/CPU. No model weights, no GPU, no network. Runs
    checks 1, 6 (against synthetic index fixtures) and 8, plus four
    structural invariants (spec presence, fused-sibling source, registry
    order, name uniqueness) and the R26 declaration-conformance family
    (every declared spec key is parsed; every parsed field is read).
  - `integration`: the vLLM-registry checks (2/3/4), skipped when vLLM is
    not importable. Their answer is vLLM-version-dependent, so they are not
    part of the default lane.
  - `slow`: the safetensors-index checks (6/7) against real checkpoints
    named by $PQ_CONFORMANCE_MODELS.

Check 5 (MTP) is deliberately absent: `build_mtp_module()` materialises a
full decoder layer (multi-GB CPU allocation). Use the manual CLI for it:

    python -m prismaquant.model_profiles.validate --model /path/to/Model

Its cheap declarative half — `has_mtp()` implies an actual
`build_mtp_module()` override plus an `mtp_source_prefix()` — IS covered
here (`test_has_mtp_implies_a_buildable_mtp_module`), which is the part
that catches the D2/§8.5-L2 defect class.

Known gaps are encoded as *ratchets*, not bare xfails: each one first
asserts the gap is still real and only then xfails. Closing the gap turns
the test red with an instruction to shrink the list, so the exemption
cannot go stale silently.

# A profile belongs here when its family has NO importable vLLM class and NO
# fusion in its HF modelling code, so it has nothing it may honestly declare:
# `fused_groups` states what a serving runtime fuses, and principle 14 refuses
# an unattested statement. `glm5_next` was that case and is no longer, so the
# set is empty rather than deleted — the mechanism is the point.
#
# What discharged it: glm5_next now declares two MLP fused groups
# (`mlp.gate_up_proj`, `mlp.shared_experts.gate_up_proj`) in its structure
# spec, and both are backed by real evidence rather than a name in someone's
# tree. The checkpoint index carries separate `mlp.gate_proj`/`mlp.up_proj`
# (dense layers) and `mlp.shared_experts.gate_proj`/`up_proj` (MoE layers)
# with no pre-fused tensor, and the 4.683-bpp artifact built under this
# profile served on vLLM TP=2 with the validator passing — i.e. the fused
# load the declaration predicts is one that actually happened. That is an
# empirical attestation, not a published runtime table; it is sound here
# because union-find promotion only ever CONSTRAINS (forces one format across
# the group), so over-declaring is conservative while under-declaring is the
# serving break.
#
# The original exemption was scoped to ATTENTION: glm5_next's KDA attention
# exposes separate q/k/v Linears live, and the only qkv fusion evidence was
# the checkpoint's `quantization_config.modules_to_not_convert` naming
# `self_attn.qkv_proj` / `self_attn.fused_qkvbfg_a_proj`, names that appear in
# no index key. That lead is still unattested — and still harmless, because
# every fusable attention projection remains pinned (see `pinned_names`), so

# ----------------------------------- R26: every declared field has a reader
#
# The bug class (audit R26, docs/audits/architecture_re-vet_2026-07-30.md):
# a spec declares something, nothing reads it, and the declaration silently
# means nothing. Four of the five plugin-lens findings in that audit are
# this one shape. A declaration can rot at either end, so both ends are
# pinned:
#
#   json key -> parser    a key in `specs/*.json` that `structure.py`'s
#                         `from_dict` never names is dropped at load, so
#                         the file describes a model the pipeline never
#                         sees. Caught by `..._key_is_parsed`.
#   parser -> consumer    `from_dict` lands the key on a dataclass field
#                         that no `base.py` accessor and no named consumer
#                         reads, so the value never reaches production.
#                         Caught by `..._field_has_a_reader`.
#
# Both halves are *necessary*, not sufficient. The consumer half is
# name-based — an attribute access or `getattr()` on a `…spec…`-named
# receiver — so it under-reports a field bound to an unusual name, and it
# cannot tell two dataclasses apart when they share a field name. What it
# does catch is a declaration with no reader at all, which is the failure
# mode actually on record.
