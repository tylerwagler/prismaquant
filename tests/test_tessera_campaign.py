"""The anchor campaign: what it measures, what it predicts, and the difference.

A Tessera family addresses thousands of rungs per unit and every one of them
needs its own encode (see ``test_no_embedded_axis_on_the_wire`` -- the
"embedded ladder" is a *decode-time completion* axis and does not exist on the
serialised wire). So the cost stage cannot be "price every rung": it measures a
few anchors per (unit, family) and interpolates between them, refuses to
extrapolate past them, and stamps every row with which of the two it was.

These tests pin the three properties that make that honest:

* a measured row is priced from its own measurement, and an interpolated row
  is priced from the family's own output-space fit -- never from a weight-space
  number wearing an output-space field name;
* a rung outside the measured envelope is **omitted**, not extrapolated;
* the render that was priced IS the decoded wire, and the wire is stored.

    """The predicate and Tessera's raise site agree, on real encodes.

    ``rung_accepts_hessian`` DERIVES its answer -- does the pinned
    ``ActivationSource`` emit an H-bearing keyword for this rung's plane --
    rather than restating Tessera's condition, which principle 14 forbids. This
    is the attestation: build real activation kwargs **on that rung's own
    resolved plane**, encode, and require that the encode succeeds exactly when
    the predicate said it would.

    The roster is derived, not named. It used to be five hand-written format
    strings, which is the "pin the rule, not the roster" defect: when the
    ``ANCHOR_BUDGET_BITS`` wall became the TCQ body's rather than the grid's
    and admitted ``BF16_K1`` -- a twelfth family, a third window width -- the
    five names did not notice, and the new family
    went unprobed by the test whose whole subject is "every family". So the
    roster is now asked for: ``menu_families()`` (the families that both render
    and serialise) crossed with the **distinct wire recipes** each one resolves
    to over ``realisable_rungs``, keeping the lowest rung that exhibits each.
    That is exactly the set of (body, plane, window width, span) the predicate
    can be asked about, at the cheapest rung per combination, and a Tessera
    release that adds a family or splits a window band grows it on its own.

    Each rep gets its own kwargs, because that is the contract: the refit
    objective is keyed by scale plane, and one shared kwargs dict -- what this
    test used to build -- prices the other planes under the first's objective.
    That construction is why the old verdict map read ``False`` for E2M1: it
    probed a LUT-plane encode with the CHANNEL plane's answer.

    Every verdict is ``True``, and that is a Tessera fact, not a taste.
    Tessera deleted both CHANNEL-only guards on 2026-09-02
    (``tessera-ldlq-lut-plane-served-2026-09-02.md``); on the LUT plane the
    H-aware wire is served KL 0.5310 against the weights-only wire's 0.6404 at
    identical bytes. So weights-only on the W4A4 route is a downgrade after
    all, and pricing it that way priced bytes the exporter does not write. The
    assertion is therefore ``all(...)`` over a derived roster rather than a
    literal map: a map would be a roster again, and would have to be edited
    every time the menu grows.
