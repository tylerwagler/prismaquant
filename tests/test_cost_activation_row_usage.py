"""Row usage and failure behaviour of the batched cost measurement.

Two defects are pinned here.

ROW TRUNCATION. ``measure_batched_gpu`` used to truncate every Linear in a
chunk to ``min(rows)`` over the chunk's members. On a MoE layer that minimum is
set by the single least-routed expert, so from DSv4-Flash layer 3 onward every
one of the 768 expert Linears had its ``output_mse`` computed from ONE token
row while up to 63 cached rows were thrown away. Each Linear now gets its own
rows, via one BMM per distinct row count (no padding, no waste).

FAIL-OPEN ERRORS. A measurement exception used to be swallowed into a silent
per-chunk ``{"error": ...}``, turning up to ``chunk_size`` priced rows into
holes the allocator reads as "format not offered here". It now aborts.
