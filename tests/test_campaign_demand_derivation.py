"""The dispatcher's memory demand, derived from the plan the row checks itself against.

A campaign row states a PrismaBuild memory demand; PrismaBuild turns that
number into a cgroup cap; the row then refuses unless its own phase plan fits
under that cap less the floor it measures for itself, and its guard refuses
again at ``cap - margin``. Three quantities, two of them outside the plan, and
until RobTand/prismaquant#522 the demand carried neither.

Everything here runs on an injected plan. No model files, no NFS, no GPU: what
is under test is the arithmetic that joins the demand to the predicate, not any
measurement of a real checkpoint.
