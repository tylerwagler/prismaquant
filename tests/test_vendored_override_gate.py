"""The profile registry must refuse a model_type whose vendored override died.

Issue #19's real defect was silence: `register_qwen3()` returned cleanly, set
its "registered" flag, and the run then executed UPSTREAM modelling code with
no exception anywhere. `prismaquant.vendored` now verifies its own overrides
and records the dead ones — but `detect_profile` calls
`register_vendored_modeling()` inside a `try/except: pass` (correctly: a
vendoring failure must not break profile *detection*), so the recorded failure
has to be consulted explicitly or the swallow re-hides it.

These tests pin that consultation, not the vendored machinery itself.

They also pin where the refusal is allowed to STOP (issue #201). A gate that
raises inside a `try: ... except Exception: continue` is not a gate: until
`_resolve` was reordered, a recorded dead override merely demoted the profile
that matched and detection answered `DefaultProfile` — the silent wrong answer
the gate's own docstring says it refuses. So the refusal must reach the caller
of `detect_profile`, and it must arrive as its own class, so a caller can tell
"no profile matched this checkpoint" (a `DefaultProfile`, sometimes fine) from
"a profile matched and its vendored path is dead" (never fine).

    #201 made `_resolve` raise `DeadVendoredOverrideError` and stopped three
    gate call sites from re-swallowing it. #202 is the rest of the census: 22
    further call sites across 11 modules each wrapped detection in a broad
    `except Exception` and continued with a substituted profile (`None`,
    `DefaultProfile()`, `keep_composite = False`, a hardcoded prefix guess, a
    count of 0, a bare `False`), which converts the refusal straight back into
    the silent wrong answer one level up.

    This is a structural pin as well as 18 behavioural ones above, because the
    rule is structural: a dead override must never be *answered*. It therefore
    also covers the four sites whose enclosing function cannot be reached
    without a GPU, a loaded checkpoint or a built streaming context

    `sensitivity_probe.py:3592`, `streaming_production_cache.py:1776`) — and it
    fails for a call site added next month, which no per-site test would.

    of the handler that catches it, or (b) a handler that always re-raises,
    which is what `sample_parallel_probe` already did correctly.

    What this census does NOT cover, since it is cited as future-proofing
    (#217): it is a syntactic walk of `prismaquant/`, so it cannot see a
    detection call reached through an alias or a variable
    (`fn = detect_profile; fn(path)`), a `getattr`/`importlib` dispatch, a
    swallow one frame up in a caller's own `try`, an `except` clause whose
    class is computed rather than named, or anything outside the package tree
