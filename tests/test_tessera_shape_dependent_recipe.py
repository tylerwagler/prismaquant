"""The seam under a wire recipe whose size is a function of the shape.

Tessera's E4M3 grid is scheduled to move from the TCQ body over a block scale
plane to the **window body over the CHANNEL plane**
(``tessera.export.wire_recipe``'s own docstring names the flip and its gates;
measured 0.985x of EXL3 K4 at 4.0 bpp).  That recipe charges two things no
bits-per-parameter rate can state: one fp16 per output row, and one
``2**L``-byte window table per unit.  The same rung is 4.0078 bpp on a
2048x4096 tensor and 4.4653 bpp on a 96x768 one.

These tests run the seam in that world by substituting ``wire_recipe`` for the
E4M3 grids only, and they assert the substitution took effect before asserting
anything else -- the recipe lookup is memoised, so a test that forgot to clear
the cache would otherwise pass while measuring today's wire.

The authority for every number here is ``tessera.calculator.terminal_rate``,
called directly with the plane flags the recipe implies, never through the code
under test.
