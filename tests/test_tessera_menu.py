"""The three gates a Tessera rung passes before the DP can see it.

Tessera's rate axis is continuous at a 1/256-bpp quantum, so "the menu" is not
a list somebody typed -- it is whatever three independent gates agree on:

* the **wire** can serialise these bytes (Tessera's own grammar),
* the **shape** tiles, including the shard a declared tensor-parallel degree
  hands the runtime,
* the pinned **runtime** attests the route (or the run explicitly opts into a
  research menu that says it does not).

These tests pin each gate separately, pin that the reductions applied
afterwards are the exact ones (dominance, never a hull), and pin that a menu
with no Tessera rung on it behaves exactly as it did before any of this
existed.

    Locating the packaged contract imports the ``tessera.serving`` package
    itself -- ``resources.files`` imports it -- but that import is lazy by
    design (it defines ``register()`` and calls nothing at module scope), so
    it registers nothing and needs no GPU.

    Until lane schema v9 this also asserted that ``tessera.serving.contract``
    stayed out of ``sys.modules``, on the stated grounds that "its validator
    imports the plugin's dispatch tables".  Two things changed.  Reading a v9
    table REQUIRES that module -- the smoke record's status and attribution
    are derived by Tessera's own ``derive_smoke_status`` /
    ``derive_smoke_attribution``, and restating those rules here is the
    two-homes defect RobTand/tessera#327 was filed about.  And the stated
    grounds stopped being true: at the pinned commit that module imports only
    the standard library at module scope and defers every dispatch-table
    import into a function body (Tessera's own ``test_contract_is_portable``
    holds it there).

    So the module name was a PROXY for the property, and the proxy no longer
    tracks it.  This asserts the property in two halves instead.

    First: the read pulls in no vLLM, and its ``tessera.serving`` surface is
    confined to the portable contract module -- none of the dispatch modules
    (``ops``, ``native_ops``, ``moe_route``, ``sharding``, ``ext``, ``lane``,
    ``scheme``) is loaded, which is what "no serving runtime" actually means.
    Second, checked separately because it is Tessera's claim and not this
    repository's: importing ``tessera.serving.contract`` on its own pulls in
    no torch, no Triton and no vLLM.

    The second half is measured in a bare interpreter deliberately.  Torch is
    already in ``sys.modules`` by the time the first half runs -- ``prismaquant``
    itself imports it, on this branch and on main alike -- so asserting
    "no torch" around the read would assert something about this package's
    own import weight and prove nothing about Tessera.

    """The DP sees the group's exact knapsack, not one shared rung.

    This test used to pin the opposite, and said a later change that made the
    DP mixed-rung capable would have to come here and say so. This is that
    change, and here is what it says.

    The old aggregation built one super-item candidate per format **name**, by
    intersecting the members' menus, so the DP could only return a single rung
    for a whole fused group. Two things were wrong with reading that as the
    serving constraint. It is too tight: the runtime dispatches on the
    **decoder** -- the grid and arity a Tessera family names -- and a shared
    rate is not a dispatch property, while q_proj and k_proj are different
    tensors with different sensitivities. And on a continuous rate axis it is
    ruinous rather than merely conservative: the intersection of two members'
    *measured* menus can be a single rung, which is how a group's whole menu
    collapses for a reason that has nothing to do with Tessera.

    So the group's option set is now the Minkowski sum of its members' (bytes,
    cost) menus restricted to one ``(family, shared-signature)`` cell -- the
    group's own exact multi-choice knapsack, kept as a Pareto set under
    dominance (never a hull). Every option agrees on every field the pinned
    contract marks shared and carries a rate per member.

    **The premise is now attested, and read rather than asserted (#132).**
    That a runtime decodes a fused module as per-member wires it concatenates
    -- what free per-member rates require, since
    ``bresenham_rate_schedule(root, n_columns)`` is a per-COLUMN quota shared
    by every row of ONE unit -- is a fact about that runtime, and Tessera
    publishes it: ``fused_module.fields`` marks ``q256`` ``per_member``
    (contract v6, RobTand/tessera#37), and the fold reads that block instead
    of restating it. The licence passed below is the installed contract's own,
    so this enumerates mixed rungs only while that block says so. Two things
    it still does not say: ``mixed_rung_receipt`` is ``false``, so no *serve*
    has covered such a module, and principle 9's export gate is what decides
    whether such an assignment ships.
