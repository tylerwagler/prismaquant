"""The served-lane gold tool: what it computes, and what it refuses.

Before this tool the only gold measurement tools were DSv4's, which construct
an in-process `LLM` under a contract pinning `tokenizer_mode="deepseek_v4"`.
Every other lane therefore measured with run-local scripts that emitted a bare
number and no identity -- no serve fingerprint, no producer commit, no
spec-decode state, no workload contract -- which is exactly the evidence a ship
record binds. These tests pin the arithmetic and, more importantly, the
refusals: a gold number that cannot say which stack produced it is the failure
mode the whole R15 fingerprint mechanism exists to prevent.
