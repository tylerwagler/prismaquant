"""§7.4: a Tessera serve must not fingerprint as "no lane extension resident".

KL is bit-identical *within* one docker session and drifts 4-8x *across* them,
keyed purely on whether a lane's CUDA `.so` was loaded into the serving process
(loading a CUDA extension shifts allocator addresses, activations get different
pointer alignments, and alignment-sensitive heuristics pick different kernels).
``tools/serve_fingerprint.py`` makes that stack an object so an A/B can be
refused when its arms differ.

Until 2026-09-02 the alternation named Gridbook's `.so` and, after the
Gridbook lane retired, named no Tessera one at all -- so a serve running
Tessera's OWN native span-2 decode produced the same fingerprint as a stock
serve, and the one lane whose entire point is a custom decoder was the one
lane §7.4 could not see.

**Three links, and this file refuses all three.**  What the fingerprint has to
know -- which library, under which filename pattern, matched by which rule --
is a claim about the TESSERA runtime, so principle 14 says it is read from
that runtime's own table or refused.  Since Tessera contract v7 the table
exists (``native_extensions``), and the chain is:

1. contract -> pin: ``tessera_runtime_contract`` refuses a serving pin whose
   ``serving_native_extensions`` is not the pinned contract's table.  Until
   this file's 2026-09-03 revision the pin was a HAND-WRITTEN claim about
   another runtime with nothing here to refuse it -- and it was already wrong
   by one character (``"tessera_nvfp4"`` where the load path's constant is
   ``"tessera_nvfp4_"``).
2. pin -> tool: the tool is stdlib-only and cannot read either file from
   inside a serving container, so it carries the rows and any disagreement
   fails here.
3. the tool's PREDICATE -> the contract's ``match`` rule: the old pattern was
   a bare substring search over the whole mapped path, and the contract says
   the runtime is matched by ``basename_fnmatch`` against
   ``tessera_nvfp4_*.so``.  Those are different predicates and only one of
   them is the runtime's.

The contract is read by ``json`` through ``tessera_runtime_contract`` -- located
through ``importlib.resources.files("tessera.serving")``, which imports only
that package's lazy ``__init__`` (it defines ``register()`` and calls nothing
at module scope, so it registers nothing and needs no GPU), and never through
``tessera.serving.contract``, whose validator imports the plugin's dispatch
tables -- and never by vendoring a copy.
