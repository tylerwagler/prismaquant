"""Contracts for the fixed-resource admission gate, `admit_fixed_resources`.

Every fixture here is synthetic and says so. A positive fixture proves the
recomputation and agreement contract only; it establishes no measurement, and
this gate admits nothing at the producer's current schema version -- what it
refuses is derived rather than unconditional, which is the whole change.

Each test below is a discrimination, not an assertion that a refusal exists:
it names a refusal the agreeing baseline does not carry and shows it appears
only when its property is broken. A check that cannot fail is not a check, so
the refusals this schema version can never lift -- the absent timing
partition, the unversioned native/full-engine charge boundary, the fixed
member roster the partition does not name -- are asserted as *disclosures* in
one test that says so, never dressed up as checks.
