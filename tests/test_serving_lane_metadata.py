"""Serving-lane metadata on allocator candidates — what survives P5b.

Rewritten 2026-09-02, when the Gridbook codebook (NVFP4-CB / FP8-CB) serving
lane was retired to ``archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/``.

This file used to pin four things, all of them through the ``nvfp4_cb``
serving profile: the two per-grid N-dimension load gates, the fused-mid-M
backed rung set as version-keyed spec data, the route travelling on every
``Candidate``, and the backed/fallback split in the shipped
``selection.json``.  ``prismaquant/serving_profile_specs/nvfp4_cb.json`` was
the ONLY spec in the repo that ever declared a ``serving_lanes`` block, so
the first three lost their subject outright when it went: no surviving
profile (gguf, research, tessera_research_sm121,
vllm_glm5_next_packed_moe, vllm_packed_moe, vllm_qwen3_5_packed_moe) declares
a lane, a
``route_status``, an ``activation_contract`` or a ``fused_mid_m`` set.  That
is a recorded capability loss (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md debt D34), not a bug to
route around, and the deleted tests below say so in place rather than being
re-pointed at a profile that would answer them vacuously.

What still has a subject, and is what this file now pins:

1. ``serving_lane_route`` returns ``None`` for a profile that declares no
   lane — which is today every profile.
2. The end-to-end ``selection.json`` / ``format_applicability.json`` blocks:
   the P5a activation-fair-pricing verdict, the republished cross-family
   ladder verdict, and a serving-lane provenance report in which every
   selected unit is honestly laneless.

The CB format/cost/render plumbing (``cb_layout``, ``nvfp4_cb_formats``,
``format_registry``'s ``*_CB_*`` FormatSpecs) was deliberately kept, so CB
rungs are still registered and still priceable; nothing offers or ships them.

# 1. The N-dimension load gates  — DELETED 2026-09-02
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Eight tests (23 parametrized cases) are gone from here:
#
#   test_fp4_cb_rungs_load_on_out_features_multiple_of_8      (5 params)
#   test_fp4_cb_rungs_are_masked_off_a_non_multiple_of_8      (5 params)
#   test_fp8_cb_rungs_load_on_out_features_multiple_of_16     (4 params)
#   test_fp8_cb_rungs_are_masked_off_a_non_multiple_of_16     (5 params)
#   test_the_two_families_load_gates_really_are_different
#   test_the_load_gates_are_declared_per_grid_from_the_family_table
#   test_the_load_gates_do_not_touch_the_native_carriers
#   test_the_superblock_gate_is_unchanged
#
# They asserted that the fp4-CB family loads only on ``out_features % 8 == 0``
# and the fp8-CB family only on ``out_features % 16 == 0``; that the two gates
# are genuinely different at N=8; that both are derived from
# ``cb_layout.FAMILIES`` rather than hand-listed; that the gates leave the
# native NVFP4 / FP8_DYNAMIC / BF16 carriers alone; and that the older
# ``in_features % 256`` superblock gate was not relaxed by the others.
#
# All three rules --- cb_superblock_shape, cb_fp4_out_features_load_gate,
# cb_fp8_out_features_load_gate --- were declared in
# prismaquant/serving_profile_specs/nvfp4_cb.json and went with it to
# archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/.  No surviving profile declares any of
# them, so there is no gate left to assert about.
#
# The two "loads on a legal N" tests (nine cases) and the native-carrier one
# were still GREEN at deletion --- ten of the thirteen this file still passed
# --- which is exactly why they had to go too:
# ``check_serving_shape`` catches ``FileNotFoundError`` and silently resolves
# an unknown profile id to ``research``, which permits every shape.  They were
# passing on permit-all, not on a gate --- a tautology wearing a gate's
# docstring.
#
# The tail of test_the_load_gates_are_declared_per_grid_from_the_family_table
# also asserted the ladder partition
# (``NVFP4_CB_FORMAT_NAMES | FP8_CB_FORMAT_NAMES == CB_FORMAT_NAMES``, and the
# two disjoint).  That is still covered: tests/test_cb_layout.py pins each
# family against the registry (``list_producer_formats("fp8_cb")`` /
# ``("nvfp4_cb")``) and their union against ``cb_layout.CB_FORMAT_NAMES``.

# 2. The fused-lane route as versioned spec data  — DELETED 2026-09-02
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Eight tests are gone from here:

#   test_an_undeclared_runtime_version_backs_nothing
#   test_fp4_cb_declares_the_bf16_bridge_and_no_fused_mid_m_lane
#   test_the_lane_catalog_is_reportable_and_names_its_runtime
#
# Between them they pinned: that FP8_CB's backed fused-mid-M set is version
# keyed and equals ``range(28, 49, 4)`` under every declared Gridbook release
# 0.5.0..0.8.5; that the set is the ``k % 4 == 0`` TMA/sub-table law rather
# than an incomplete instantiation list; that advancing the pin ADDS a version
# key and never edits an old one, so an artifact stays resolvable at the route
# it shipped on; that FP8_BLOCK_UE8M0_SOURCE serves W8A16 while
# MXFP8_UE8M0_G32 serves W8A8; that the fp4-CB fused mid-M kernel is AVAILABLE
# behind PRISMAQUANT_CB_FP4_FUSED_MIDM but not BACKED; that an undeclared
# runtime version backs nothing (fail-closed); that every fp4-CB rung rides
# the ``w4-bf16-bridge`` fallback; and that the whole lane catalog is
# reportable and names its runtime.
#
# Every one of those facts lived in the ``serving_lanes`` block of
# prismaquant/serving_profile_specs/nvfp4_cb.json, the only spec in the repo
# that ever carried one (archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/).  With it gone the
# structured per-lane route_status / activation_contract / fused_mid_m table
# has ZERO live declarations, ``sp.gridbook_runtime_version`` no longer
# exists, and there is nothing left for these to read.  They are deleted
# rather than re-pointed: re-pointing at a profile that declares no lane would

#   test_selection_provenance_splits_backed_rungs_from_the_fallback
#   test_selection_provenance_reads_the_route_off_the_chosen_candidate
#
# They pinned that ``build_candidates`` attaches a resolved route to every
# Candidate and to the ``_serving_lane_by_format`` side map; that
# ``selection_serving_lane_provenance`` splits the selected rungs into
# backed-fused / fallback / no-declared-lane buckets with a per-format
# breakdown and an activation-contract histogram; and that the provenance
# reads a route off the chosen candidate first, re-resolving from the profile
# only for expanded members of aggregated super items.
#
# All three drove ``target_profile="nvfp4_cb"``.  With no profile declaring a
# lane, every candidate's ``serving_lane`` is ``None`` and every bucket but
# ``units_without_declared_lane`` is empty by construction, so the split these
# tests exist to check has no subject.  The laneless case is still covered
# end to end by test_selection_json_carries_the_p5a_and_p5b_provenance below.
#
# ONE live assertion went with them: test_selection_provenance_reads_the_route
# _off_the_chosen_candidate also pinned the ``activation_pricing_branches``
# stamping for an expanded member with no candidate of its own
# (``branches["unrecorded"] == 1``, total == 3).  That code path
# (prismaquant/allocator_candidates.py, the branch_counts accumulation behind
# "activation_pricing_branches") is profile independent and still works under
