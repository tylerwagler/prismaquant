"""The adapter's own half: what it emits, what it refuses, and what it will not do.

Nothing here touches PrismaBuild.  These are the properties that have to hold
before a request is worth submitting at all -- that one frozen plan emits one
set of bytes, that a plan missing a measured cost is refused rather than
defaulted, that a child cannot answer for a task outside its own batch, and that
a missing fleet capability is reported by name instead of routed around.

The other half -- that PrismaBuild reads what this emits, cuts it into the
children we expect, and closes the group on an exact cover -- is in
``test_quality_prefill_pb_adapter_serve_once.py``, which runs in process against
a checkout of PB #518.
