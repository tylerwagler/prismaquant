"""The Tessera EXPORT lane: vocabulary, declaration, and three fail-closed gates.

Rob's decision of 2026-09-02 made the sanctioned serving lanes
compressed-tensors, GGUF and Tessera.  ``run-pipeline.sh`` implemented the
retirement half the same day (``EXPORT_CONTAINER=nvfp4_cb`` fails closed); the
addition half is what this module pins.

The shape being pinned matters more than the values.  Being *in* the
``EXPORT_CONTAINER`` vocabulary is not permission to build: an architecture
still has to declare the lane, and the lane still has to clear a preflight
whose three gates are each read from the pinned runtime's own published table.
Today the third gate -- the release pin -- refuses every run, and it is the
ONLY thing that does.  That is the difference this file protects: the refusal
is the pin's, spoken where an operator can act on it, rather than "unknown
export lane" from a vocabulary check three layers up.
