"""R6 (reader half) — export-lane eligibility as model configuration.

`EXPORT_CONTAINER` is an operator env var with no relationship to whether the
architecture is wired for that lane. Nothing stopped `EXPORT_CONTAINER=<lane>`
on an arch whose expert loader for that lane is a TODO: the run completes, the
artifact serves, and the FusedMoE reads uninitialised memory — coherent-looking
garbage, not a crash (commit `9a79963`, Laguna, 93% of parameters).

This file pins the spec fields, profile accessors, and the preflight helper
wired by `run-pipeline.sh`.

The lane vocabulary lost `nvfp4_cb` on 2026-09-02 when the Gridbook codebook
lane was retired (`archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/`). The cases below were
re-pointed at the lanes that remain rather than deleted: the *mechanism* — an
architecture declares its lanes, and the preflight refuses an undeclared one —
is exactly what the retirement leaves standing, and it is what the Tessera
lane will be admitted through.

# `GGUF_WIRED` / `TESSERA_WIRED` lived here until 2026-09-03: two module-level
# sets named after two specific lanes, asserted by name in one test. That is
# the roster-instead-of-rule shape (the eighth instance across these two
# repositories), and its cost is precise: a THIRD non-default lane would have
# been covered by nothing, because the test named two lanes and said nothing
# about any other. The rosters moved into `lane_specs/<lane>.json`'s
# `wired_architectures`, beside everything else about that lane, and the
# assertions below are properties quantified over EXPORT_LANES.
#
# `wired_architectures` moved the roster beside the lane, which is the right
# home for it, and the agreement below is two files written by two authors
# answering one question. What neither file can answer is whether the wiring
# EXISTS: there is no per-architecture lane-wiring table in this repository
# (GGUF's architecture comes out of llama.cpp's own skeleton at export time,
# and Tessera's gate constrains structure -- "dense" -- rather than
# architecture), so a lockstep edit across the two files still satisfies the
# agreement, which is the Laguna failure mode (`9a79963`) in two files instead
# of one. #150 therefore adds a THIRD conjunct, derived from a place neither
# roster maintains: `serving_profile_specs/*.json` declare an `export_lane`,
# layered through `extends`, so an architecture's `default_serving_profile`
# resolves to exactly one lane, and `lane_specs/*.json` say which serving
# profiles serve a lane. An architecture whose serving profile goes to
# compressed-tensors cannot declare the GGUF lane, whatever either roster says.
#
# It is a weaker claim than "the exporter is wired for this arch" and says so.
# The Tessera lane is the honest hole: its own spec declares NO serving
# profiles, because the plugin is chosen by the checkpoint's
# `quantization_config.quant_method`, so the third conjunct has nothing to bite
# on there and `qwen3`'s declaration rests on the two rosters alone. That
# absence is read out of the lane spec below rather than encoded as a name to
