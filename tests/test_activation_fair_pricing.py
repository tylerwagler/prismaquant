"""Activation-fair pricing for weight-only cost rows — ultraplan P5a item 1.

Gridbook's ``docs/audits/ultraplan_perf_2026-08-01.md`` §6 ("Three cost-model
asymmetries", #1): *W4A4 vs W8A8 activation cost is priced only on the
measured ``output_mse`` branch*. Packed experts under
``PRISMAQUANT_EXPERT_COST_SAMPLE`` and ladder-interpolated rungs under
``CB_LADDER_INTERP`` are written with ``output_mse_measured=False``, so they
fall to weight-only Fisher pricing where the activation contract is
structurally invisible — "NVFP4-CB gets credit for its cheaper index stream
with none of its A-side cost, on most rows of a production run".

What this file pins:

1. The fit is a per-family GEOMETRIC MEAN of the measured-over-weight-only
   estimator ratio, exact on synthetic rows, for BOTH CB families.
2. It is applied to weight-only rows of its own family and nowhere else —
   never to a measured row, never to an activation-identity format, never to
   another family.
3. The fail-closed policy: a MIXED scale (one family calibrated, another with
   uncorrected weight-only rows) refuses by name; a run with no measured
   activation rows at all passes through with the verdict recorded, because
   it introduces no asymmetry and refusing would make currently-legal
   research runs illegal.
4. ``PRISMAQUANT_ACTIVATION_FAIR_PRICING=0`` restores pre-P5a prices exactly.
5. No existing gate is weakened: a multiplicative penalty cannot lift an
   exactly-0.0 price off the DP's global minimum, so the
   ``ACTIVATION_COST_UNMEASURED_REASON`` candidate removal keeps firing.
6. Aggregated (fused-sibling / packed-serving-group) super items fold the
   penalty in exactly ONCE.

# NOTE 2026-09-02: every `build_candidates(...)` call below used
# `target_profile="nvfp4_cb"` until the Gridbook codebook lane retired
# (archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/). That serving profile was the only spec
# in the repo that admitted a CB rung, so the calls started returning an empty
# candidate map and these tests failed on KeyErrors rather than on their
# subject. They are re-pointed at `research`, which declares no export lane and
# no format-menu restriction -- exactly the status the CB pricing plumbing now
# has (debt D34): priceable and renderable, servable nowhere. Verified that
# `research` returns the CB rungs legal rather than silently dropping them
# (`check_format_applicability((2048,2048), "FP8_CB_K36", target_profile=
# "research") -> legal`, while `vllm_packed_moe` answers
# `exporter_cannot_emit`). The activation-fair-pricing arithmetic under test is
# unchanged.

    An expert unit's weight-only rows make NVFP4-CB look strictly better than

    its cheaper index stream with none of its A-side cost". The measured

    3x what the weight-only estimator reports while the W8 family's costs
    1x. With that transfer applied, the same DP at the same byte budget picks
    FP8-CB instead.
