"""Bounded, ordered publication of artifacts the campaign has already made.

The Tessera campaign encodes a batch of units on the GPU, scores each one, and
then writes two files per unit: the rendered weight shard through
:func:`prismaquant.production_weight_cache._store_rendered_weight_entry`, and
the ``.tessera`` wire blob beside it.  Both writes happen on the thread that
just finished the encode, so the next batch's encode does not start until the
previous batch's bytes are on disk.  On the R1088 endpoint a sixteen-unit arm
spends about 1.13 to 1.16 s inside sixteen ``torch.save`` calls and about
0.40 s inside sixteen ``Path.write_bytes`` calls, against roughly 54 us of
fsync: that is serialisation and copying, not device latency, and none of it
needs the GPU.

This module hands those two writes to one bounded writer thread so they can run
while the next batch encodes.  What it deliberately does **not** do:

* **It is not a second cache.**  A job calls the same
  ``_store_rendered_weight_entry`` and the same tmp-plus-``os.replace`` wire
  write the synchronous path calls, with the same arguments.  There is one
  cache mechanism and this is not another one.
* **It does not change what durable means.**  ``_store_rendered_weight_entry``
  is invoked exactly as the campaign invokes it today, so a published file is
  one that has been through ``os.replace``, and an fsync happens only where
  ``release_completed_anchor_file_pages`` is configured.  Publication here
  means *the same thing it means now*, on another thread.
* **It does not decide when a receipt is written.**  The publisher only reports
  which jobs are finished.  The caller is what turns a finished job into a
  journal row, and that is the ordering rule the campaign has to keep: an
  anchor may not reach the checkpoint before its own bytes have.

Ownership and bounds:

* The caller stages the CPU bytes -- the device-to-host copy stays on the
  thread that owns the device work -- and then transfers them.  A submitted job
  owns its tensor and its blob until it is published, and nothing else may
  write to them.
* **The budget is reserved before the bytes are made, not after.**  The caller
  calls :meth:`reserve` with the size it is about to stage, and that call is
  what blocks; only then does it allocate.  Charging at submit time would have
  left the producer holding one more artifact than the budget allows, because
  the copy it is about to hand over already exists by then.  An artifact
  larger than the whole budget is refused rather than admitted as a special
  case: admitting it would mean the declared bound is not the bound, and the
  answer to a render that does not fit is a bigger budget, chosen by whoever
  is accounting for the memory.
* One writer thread and a FIFO queue, so jobs run in submission order and
  completions are reported in that order.  Recovery stays deterministic.

Failure is closed.  When a job raises, the writer keeps the exception, discards
everything queued behind it *without writing any of it*, and every later
:meth:`submit` and :meth:`drain` raises :class:`PublicationError` from the
original.  Jobs that finished before the failure are real files, so
:meth:`completed` still reports them and the caller may journal them; that is
what makes the resume after a failed action skip work it has actually done
rather than redo it or, worse, trust a row whose bytes never landed.
