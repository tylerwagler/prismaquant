"""The ``coverage_first_v1`` screen: what the initial menu may and may not drop.

Specification section 5.4 of ``docs/design/tessera_quality_prefill_experiment.md``.

``coverage_first_v1`` is the experiment's *initial* screen policy, and its
defining property is negative: **it never prunes**. It retains the mandatory
boundary and control candidates, the frozen per-stratum interior draw, and at
least one representative of every distinct licensed activation/route class.
Everything else is deferred, which is a statement about acquisition order, not
about merit. :func:`apply_coverage_first_v1` emits no ``pruned`` disposition
at all, and ``tests/test_quality_prefill_screen.py`` asserts that.

That is not squeamishness. Section 5.4's reason is mechanical: before runtime
prices exist, a quality-or-byte dominance argument cannot see that the deleted
candidate was the faster one. :func:`refuse_dominance_screen` makes the
argument refuse out loud rather than quietly succeed on partial evidence.

Caps are the other half. ``max_retained_candidates``,
``max_composite_options`` and ``max_tasks_per_phase`` are applied *after* the
exact roster and its licensed composite expansion, and a cap that the
mandatory coverage already exceeds refuses the freeze, naming required versus
allowed. It never reduces a quota, drops a class, or retains a prefix: a
smaller plan is a different plan, and picking one silently is how a screen
becomes a result.
