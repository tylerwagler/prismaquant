"""format_registry.py — extensible quantization format catalog.

A FormatSpec describes everything the pipeline needs to treat a format
uniformly:

  - name                    canonical identifier
  - weight_bits             weight element width
  - group_size              per-group scale granularity; 0 = per-channel
  - weight_element_dtype    torch dtype used on disk
  - scale_bits              bits consumed by per-group scales
  - scale_dtype_name        human-readable scale dtype
  - effective_bits          total bits/param (weight + scale amortized)
  - autoround_config()      dict AutoRound consumes via --layer_config
  - quantize_dequantize(w)  apply RTN in-place (for closed-loop MSE)
  - min_capability_sm       minimum SM arch (useful for hardware filter)
  - static_activation_contract
                            the served static-scale activation contract
                            (which quantiser, which per-unit G rule), or None

Users register new formats with @register_format. New hardware formats
(e.g. a future MX variant or Ada W4A8) can be added without touching
core code.

          * ``act_bits is None`` — the field is simply not applicable
            (BF16, FP8_SOURCE, NVFP4A16, MXFP8A16, INT8_W8A16, ...);
          * ``act_bits >= 16`` — "activations are 16-bit", i.e. not

        compute), so even a bit-identical weight tensor changes the layer
        output through the A side.

        This is the single predicate for that question. Consumers must use
        it rather than re-deriving it from ``act_bits``: the allocator's
        bit-exact cost short-circuit

        validator's activation-quant assignment, ``layer_state_cache`` and

# MXFP8_UE8M0_G32 — MX-FP8 with the saturating-ceil shared-exponent rule and
# a native ``float8_e8m0fnu`` scale plane.  Built for the Gridbook lane, which
# was retired 2026-09-02 (archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/); the format stays
# registered and priceable, but no exporter writes it and no live serving
# profile admits it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, D34).
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT JUST ``MXFP8_E4M3``. It has the same element grid (E4M3),
# the same group (32 along K) and the same 8.25 bpw, so the obvious question
# is why the registry carries two. Three reasons, in the order that matters:
#
#   * SCALE RULE. MXFP8_E4M3 defers to compressed-tensors, which is the right
#     authority for the stock vLLM lane it ships on. That rule rounds the
#     group amax to a power of two, which can scale a group UP and knock the
#     smallest normals off the E4M3 subnormal ladder. This format instead
#     picks the smallest non-clipping exponent, which is what buys the
#     exactness property below. See ``mx_formats.mxfp8_ue8m0_shared_exponent``.
#   * SCALE DTYPE. The stock lane serializes E8M0 as ``uint8``; this one
#     serializes ``float8_e8m0fnu``, the spelling DeepSeek-V4 already uses for
#     its own block scales and the one the retired Gridbook consumer read.
#   * LANE. It rides its own wire id, not the compressed-tensors scheme.  The
#     lane that served it is retired (2026-09-02); no sanctioned lane
#     (compressed-tensors, GGUF, Tessera) executes these bytes.
#
# That is the same "different on-disk contract, therefore a different format"
# call FP8_BLOCK_UE8M0_SOURCE made against FP8_SOURCE, and the reason the
# ``MXFP8 -> MXFP8_E4M3`` alias above is deliberately left alone: historical
# artifacts and launchers spelled the stock compressed-tensors rung ``MXFP8``,
# and quietly repointing that name at a rung with a different codec, a
# different scale plane and a different serving lane would reinterpret every
# persisted assignment that uses it.
#
# EXACT ON BLOCK-FP8 SOURCES, ON THE WEIGHT PLANE. Any tensor whose stored
# form is E4M3 codes times a shared power of two — the DeepSeek
# ``fp8_e4m3_ue8m0_block128`` body convention — re-encodes here with ZERO
# weight error: the ceil rule never picks an exponent above the block's own, so
# every element is an E4M3 code scaled down by a power of two, which is exactly
# representable. 128 = 4*32, so a 32-wide chunk never straddles a block
# boundary and the scale map is pure replication. This is a property of the
# rule, not a measurement, and tests/test_mxfp8_ue8m0.py pins it.
#
# Read that claim precisely: it is ``weight_mse == 0.0``, NOT ``output_mse ==
# 0.0``. The lane below quantizes activations, so a weight-lossless unit still
# has real A-side error — which is exactly why ``cost_entry_is_bit_exact``
# refuses to short-circuit a W·A· format on a zero weight_mse.
#
# RE-QUANTIZATION, NOT PASSTHROUGH. Unlike the ``*_SOURCE`` family this is
# legal on ANY source dtype: it has a real encoder, so it is deliberately
# absent from SOURCE_PASSTHROUGH_CONTRACTS and is not source-gated.
#
# W8A8, WITH THE A SIDE MEASURED. The A-side contract priced here is the one
# the Gridbook lane executed until its retirement on 2026-09-02
# (``Mxfp8DenseLinearMethod``, archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/): activations
# quantized dynamically to MXFP8 per 32 reduction-axis elements, using the
# SAME saturating-ceil rule as the weights — no static global scale to fit,
# unlike NVFP4's ``nv_fp4_with_static_gs``. Declaring that here is not
# bookkeeping: ``act_bits=8`` is what makes the cost stage apply
# ``activation_quantize_dequantize`` before measuring ``output_mse``, so a
# measured row carries genuine W8A8 error. Declaring A16 instead would price
# an activation path that contract did not take, and on a block-FP8 source
# (weight_mse exactly 0.0) would hand the DP a free zero-cost rung.
#
# SCOPE OF THAT CONTRACT (principle 14). It is the retired lane's executed
# contract, not a live runtime's: since 2026-09-02 no sanctioned lane executes
# this format at any unit kind, so the row is priced but never exportable.
# Should a lane ever back it, its executed A-side contract must be read from
# that runtime's packaged contract table, not from this comment.
#

#
# This is a DIFFERENT ON-DISK CONTRACT, not a cosmetic difference, which is why
# it gets its own format instead of widening FP8_SOURCE:
#
#   * bytes. FP8_SOURCE charges 32 bits per 128x128 block (8.00195 bpw); this
#     charges 8 (8.00049 bpw). Measured on DSv4-Flash: ``layers.0.attn.wo_a``
#     is 33,554,432 weight bytes + 2,048 scale bytes, which is this formula
#     exactly and NOT FP8_SOURCE's.
#   * bit-exactness. The FP8_SOURCE export path widens its scale plane to FP32
#     on write. Doing that here would quadruple the scale bytes and emit a
#     tensor the checkpoint's own loader does not expect — the opposite of a
#     passthrough.
#

# weight plane and UE8M0 scale plane stayed resident and byte-verbatim and
# BF16 activations crossed the route unchanged -- which is why the format sits
# in ``SOURCE_PASSTHROUGH_CONTRACTS`` (W and A both identity).  It is
# deliberately distinct from ``MXFP8_UE8M0_G32`` above, which is a producer
# re-encode with dynamic per-32 MXFP8 activations (W8A8).  Since the

# Source-MXFP4 passthrough — the OCP-MX sibling of FP8_SOURCE, for models whose

# (DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731: ``layers.N.ffn.experts.E.{w1,w3,w2}.{weight,scale}``,
# I8 weight + F8_E8M0 scale, config ``expert_dtype: "fp4"``). When the allocator
# picks this format the exporter STREAM-COPIES those source tensors verbatim —
# no dequant, no re-encode, no CB stacking — and the serving side loads them on
# the model's own native path rather than through a codebook decoder.
#
# WHY THE ACCOUNTING IS EXACT, NOT ESTIMATED. MXFP4 is a fixed-rate format, so
# the generic FormatSpec arithmetic reproduces the checkpoint byte for byte:
# for a [2048, 4096] expert projection, 2048*4096*4/8 = 4,194,304 weight bytes
# plus 2048*(4096/32)*8/8 = 262,144 E8M0 scale bytes = 4,456,448 — precisely
# the two source slices' sizes. ``memory_bytes_for_shape`` is therefore the
# authoritative producer accountant here (unlike the CB families, whose
# FormatSpec is deliberately only a nominal view), and
# ``allocator_candidates.assert_source_passthrough_bytes_match_source`` pins
# that identity against the real safetensors index before an allocation ships.
#
# WHY Δloss IS ZERO BY CONSTRUCTION. Every cost in this pipeline is measured
# against the DEQUANTIZED SOURCE: the probe's BF16 view of an expert IS the
# lossless dequant of exactly these bytes. Shipping them unchanged is the
# identity transform on the reference, so there is nothing to measure and no
# measurement branch to take — the candidate is priced 0.0 with provenance
# ``cost_source="source_passthrough"`` (allocator_candidates
# .SOURCE_PASSTHROUGH_FORMATS). This is the same claim FP8_SOURCE makes, one
# element grid down; ``act_bits=None`` states the matching dtype-level fact
# that this producer applies no activation quantization of its own, so the row
# never enters P5a's activation calibration (its A side is the released
# checkpoint's own contract, not a re-encode this pipeline chose).
