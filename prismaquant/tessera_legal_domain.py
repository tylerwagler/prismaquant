"""The complete legal Tessera rate domain for GLM, and its support ledger.

Work package A of the quality-prefill experiment
(``docs/design/tessera_quality_prefill_experiment.md`` section 2.1).  It answers
one question and refuses to answer any other: **which ``(family, rate)`` pairs
exist at the pins this process actually reads, what do their bytes weigh, and
what does each of five independent support facts say about them.**

Three properties are the whole point.

**The domain is derived, never asserted.**  Every rate comes from
``tessera_formats.family_q256_bounds`` walked against
``tessera_menu.tessera_shape_legal`` at the real GLM Linear shapes.  The
audited counts -- 1,793 for ``TESSERA_E4M3_K1`` and 3,841 for
``TESSERA_BF16_K1`` -- are stated here as an *oracle to compare against*
(:data:`AUDITED_RATE_COUNTS`), never as the value returned.  If the derivation
disagrees, :func:`audit_oracle_report` reports the disagreement; nothing in
this module clamps a domain to reach a number.

**The five support facts are five sets, not a ladder.**  ``producer_legal``,
``reader_supported``, ``implemented_route``, ``native_qualification`` and
``export_and_served_validation`` are five separate fields on
:class:`SupportFacts`, each with its own ``source`` string naming the table
that answered.  Membership in one implies nothing about the next.  At the
current pin that asymmetry is extreme and it is the ledger's main content:
5,634 producer-legal candidates, and exactly three ``(family, rate,
structure)`` cells with native qualification.  A ledger that let singleton
attestation shrink the research domain would be wrong, so
:func:`build_inventory` computes the domain without consulting the attestation
at all and attaches it afterwards.

**A pin the code reads is not a pin the inventory was frozen under.**
:func:`live_pins` re-reads every pin at call time; :data:`FROZEN_PINS` records
what they were when the audited counts were taken; :func:`pin_drift` reports
the difference.  ``__main__`` prints the pin block and the drift verdict
*before* the counts, so a stale pin can never arrive as a silent number.

What this module deliberately does not do: it defines no manifest schema, no
driver CLI, no population selection and no allocation.  Its return values are
plain frozen dataclasses and dicts; the manifest package is expected to wrap
them.
