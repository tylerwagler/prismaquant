#   WORK_DIR=./dq-runs/qwen36 \
#   FORMATS=NVFP4,FP8_DYNAMIC,BF16 \
#     (FORMATS also accepts the menu TOKEN `TESSERA`, which stands for
#      Tessera's continuous rate axis across its three serialisable families
#      -- E2M1 arity 1 and 2 on the NVFP4/W4A4 route, E4M3 arity 1 on the
#      FP8/W8A8 route. It is a token and not a format because the realisable
#      rung set depends on each unit's column count: one 0.6B Linear carries
#      thousands of legal rungs. See the TESSERA COST STAGE guard below.)

#   VISUAL_FORMAT=BF16 \
#   CALIBRATION_MODALITY=text-only \
#   ./prismaquant/run-pipeline.sh
#
# VISUAL_FORMAT accepts any format registry name allowed by the target
# serving profile and applies to visual-encoder Linears on multimodal models.
# In text-only calibration mode it's the Phase 1 uniform override for every
# visual Linear. In multimodal mode it's the fallback applied to un-probed
# visual Linears the allocator's Fisher-driven DP didn't touch (plus the
# graceful OOM fallback on 122B-scale VLMs that can't fit the whole model in
# RAM for the multimodal pass).
#
# CALIBRATION_MODALITY (text-only | multimodal):
#   - text-only (default): body-only streaming probe + cost. Visual
#     shards emit empty pickles; allocator stamps all visual Linears
#     with --visual-format uniformly.
#   - multimodal: also runs a non-streaming second probe pass with
#     image+text calibration (synthetic stub by default; set MM_DATASET
#     to a HuggingFace dataset id to use real images). The allocator
#     treats visual Linears as regular DP candidates when real Fisher
#     stats are present. Requires ~full-model RAM; falls back to
#     text-only behavior automatically on OOM.
#
# Memory note: probe + cost peak around 90 GB on a 35B model under
# BF16 calibration. The watchdog in incremental_measure_quant_cost
# aborts cleanly on swap pressure rather than OOM-killing the host.
#
# MTP is folded into the incremental probe + cost as a built-in shard;
# mtp.* tensors are measured in the same pass as the body and land in
# the same probe/cost pickles. No separate MTP stages.
#
# LM_HEAD_FORMAT=BF16 is the historical default. A measured non-BF16 value
# (the native production rung is FP8_E4M3) is fixed outside body bpp/DP but
# inside exact artifact-byte accounting. ALLOW_PINNED=lm_head remains the
# separate research mode in which the allocator chooses the head format.

# --- TESSERA COST STAGE -----------------------------------------------------
# The `TESSERA` menu token is priced by its OWN cost stage
# (`python -m prismaquant.tessera_campaign`), not by the incremental cost
# stages: a Tessera rung has no rate a shape-free menu can enumerate, and every
# rung costs its own encode (the "embedded ladder" is a decode-time COMPLETION
# axis and does not exist on the serialised wire), so the campaign measures a
# few anchors per (unit, family) and interpolates between them under a
# leave-one-anchor-out gate. Until that stage is wired into this orchestrator,
# a run that asks for the token must be handed the campaign's cost.pkl
# explicitly. Refusing is better than emitting a cost table with no Tessera
# column and an allocation that silently contains none.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Policy §1's production problem is "minimize predicted quality loss SUBJECT TO
# exact bytes <= B, p95 TTFT <= SLO_prefill, p95 ITL <= SLO_decode_itl,
# p05 TPS >= SLO_decode_tps, resident + KV + peak_scratch <= device budget".
# Latency is NEVER blended into the objective: there is no lambda and no
# phase-weighted serve_ms. An assignment that misses an SLO is INFEASIBLE and
# is removed from the candidate set; the objective stays minimum predicted
# Delta-loss over the survivors, with the existing ratchet tie-break intact.
#
# ALL OF THESE ARE OFF BY DEFAULT. Leave SERVE_DISPATCH_TABLE empty and the
# allocator behaves exactly as it did before P5c, with a provenance stamp in
# selection.json recording that no serving constraint was evaluated (so an
# artifact never implies a latency claim it did not make).
#
# SERVE_DISPATCH_TABLE — measured per-(format-family, phase, M-regime, lane)
#   serving costs, every row citing its source document, date, GPU identity,
#   measured quantity, units and the derivation that produced the ratio. A row
#   without a source is refused at load. The in-tree EXAMPLE table was built
#   from published codebook-lane measurements and went to
#   archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/prismaquant/serve_dispatch_tables/ with
#   that lane on 2026-09-02; it was PROPOSAL DATA, never a qualified serving
#   model for any hardware. There is no in-tree example today: supply a
#   measured table or leave this empty.
# SERVE_WORKLOAD_MIX — which M-regimes the workload actually runs, e.g.
#   "prefill:dense_prefill_1400=1.0,decode:decode_batch1=1.0". Per-phase
#   weights must sum to 1.0. There is deliberately no default: policy §1
#   forbids "a default workload mix hidden in the allocator".
# SLO_* / SERVE_DEVICE_BUDGET_BYTES — the operator's hard limits. Prefill and
#   decode are separate constraints because a format can move them in opposite
#   directions (FP8-CB measures 1.44x on dense prefill and at parity on
#   batch-1 decode).
# SERVE_KV_BYTES / SERVE_PEAK_SCRATCH_BYTES — operator inputs to the device
#   memory constraint. The allocator models resident WEIGHT bytes exactly and
#   models neither of these, so it will not guess them.
#
# Whatever these produce is PROPOSAL DATA. Per NATIVE-PARITY and policy §1,
# per-layer timing tables generate candidate assignments; only the served

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# [3c] AURA additivity report (re-vet R2 precondition (ii) / R3; the R2-vs-R19
# disagreement resolved as WIRED).
#
# AURA's one structural assumption is that per-Linear KL contributions ADD.
# This stage turns that assumption into a per-artifact NUMBER —
#   residual = measured_end_KL(assignment) - sum_i predicted_dloss_i
# with an honest stderr (exact per-probe when the cost rows carry
# x2_per_probe, else the independence lower bound) — instead of a two-model
# memory. It is a REPORT: it never fails the run, and it never changes an
# allocation.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT AT [2d]. The residual needs a concrete assignment,
# and none exists until the allocator has run (and, under
# validated-surrogate, until the frontier has been selected). This is the
# first point where layer_config.json is final under both selection modes.
#
# AURA_ADDITIVITY_GATE:
#   measure (DEFAULT, ruled 2026-07-30) — report from a measured KL this run
#                    already produced when there is one (validated-surrogate's
#                    frontier JSON, free), and otherwise run ONE bounded KL
#                    measurement of the final assignment against the SAME
#                    format-menu dW cache AURA costed on (AURA_COST_NSAMPLES x
#                    AURA_COST_SEQLEN). Robert's ruling on the R2 residue: the
#                    wiring's weak spot was that under SELECTION_MODE=surrogate
#                    an artifact carried a *prediction* and no residual, so
#                    AURA's one structural assumption stayed a two-model memory
#                    instead of a per-artifact number. Every AURA-default run
#                    now performs the eval and every artifact carries a real
#                    residual. It is still a REPORT — non-blocking, and it never
#                    changes an allocation.
#   auto           — the pre-ruling behaviour: report only from a measurement
#                    the run already made; otherwise record the predicted sum
#                    with measured_kl null and a status saying why. Zero added
#                    GPU.
#   0              — off.
