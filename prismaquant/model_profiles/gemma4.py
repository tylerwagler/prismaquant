"""Gemma 4 profile (Google's multimodal family — text + vision + audio).

Covers:
  - Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration (multimodal MoE + dense, all sizes)
  - Gemma4ForCausalLM (text-only)

Almost entirely vLLM-metadata-derived — Gemma 4 has a clean
`packed_modules_mapping` (`qkv_proj`, `gate_up_proj`) and a standard
`hf_to_vllm_mapper` that matches Qwen3.5/3.6's body-prefix convention.
No MTP heads (not in vLLM's speculative registry at this vLLM version),
so PrismaQuant doesn't need a custom MTP forward builder.

Source passthrough prefixes cover the three modality towers (vision,
audio, and their embedding projectors) — these pass through as BF16
until we wire real multimodal calibration, matching the Qwen3.6 visual
encoder policy.

Minimal size: ~30 lines. Everything else inherits from base.
