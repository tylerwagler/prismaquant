"""Original Qwen3 producer profile: dense and routed-MoE text models.

The producer id is deliberately ``qwen3`` for both variants.  That spelling
is the one Gridbook's runtime contract serves; ``qwen3_moe`` is an HF/vLLM
model-type/module spelling, not a producer-contract id.

The routed model selected for the serving smoke is
``Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B`` / ``Qwen3MoeForCausalLM``.  Its checkpoint stores
per-expert 2-D ``gate_proj`` / ``up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` tensors while the
Transformers model packs them into 3-D ``gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj``
Parameters.  The structure spec owns that reversible bridge.  Dense Qwen3
models continue to resolve here; the MoE declarations are inert when no
packed expert Parameters are present.
