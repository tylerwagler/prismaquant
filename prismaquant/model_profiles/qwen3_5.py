"""Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 MoE profile.

Covers:
  - Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration (multimodal, MoE)
  - Qwen3_5MoeForCausalLM (text-only MoE)
  - Qwen3_5MoeTextModel  (headless)

The canonical ``Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`` checkpoint deliberately belongs to
this producer family: its outer config is ``qwen3_5_moe`` with architecture
``Qwen3_5MoeForConditionalGeneration``.  Its routed experts are already
packed as ``gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` tensors (256 experts, top-8), while
the one shared expert per layer remains split as gate/up/down Linears.  Keep
the producer id ``qwen3_5`` aligned with the checkpoint's actual model family;
the release name ``qwen3_6`` is not a separate producer architecture.

The naming conventions PrismaQuant must juggle:
