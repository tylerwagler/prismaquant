"""Architecture profile — PrismaQuant's adapter layer between a model
family's checkpoint conventions and the format-agnostic core pipeline.

Each profile captures three kinds of knowledge:

  1. **Naming**: how checkpoint parameter names map to vLLM's internal
     Linear qnames at compressed-tensors scheme dispatch, and the regex
     patterns vLLM uses for per-expert MoE loading.

  2. **Structure**: which Linear groups are fused siblings (q/k/v,
     gate/up, etc.), what 3D Parameters represent packed MoE experts,
     whether the architecture has MTP heads.

  3. **MTP construction**: how to stand up an HF-module replica of the
     architecture's MTP forward (for Fisher probing), which checkpoint
     prefix its tensors live under, and how to load them into it.

Profiles are picked per-run by `registry.detect_profile(model_path)`
from HF config + architectures. Unknown architectures fall back to
`DefaultProfile` which runs the generic path (common fused-sibling
groups, no MTP support, plain `model.layers.*` naming).

        disposition — ``decide``, ``pin(reason)``, or ``exclude(reason)``.
        A matmul-fed node no rule matches fails the walk with the node named
        and the op cited, which is the mechanism that keeps the next
        architecture's ``wo_a`` from shipping silently. Reasons are
        first-class output: they land on the shipcard, so write them for the
        reader of a model card, not for grep.

        The base rules, in match order:

        1. **pin** — weights of module classes the profile's spec declares in
           ``probe_skip_module_class_names``. The probe cannot price them, so
           they are held at source precision as a *named* debt. (This was
           the ``wo_a`` rule until the grouped Fisher accumulator landed:
           DSv4 declared ``DeepseekV4GroupedLinear`` here, and the walk
           turned that declaration into a named pin. Grouped classes now
           live under ``probe_grouped_module_class_names`` and are decided
           like any other Linear; the mechanism stays for the next class
           no accumulator covers.)
        2. **pin** — ``pinned_names()`` (``lm_head`` and friends).
        3. **exclude** — the MTP sidecar (``mtp_source_prefix()``), read only
           under spec decode; dispositioned by the MTP lane.
        4. **exclude** — the visual/audio tower (``visual_layer_prefix()``),
           outside the text graph this artifact serves.
        5. **exclude** — ``nn.Embedding`` weights: consumed by row gather,
           not by a GEMM; the exporter ships source bytes.
        6. **exclude** — non-persistent buffers (rotary caches, derived
           tables): never serialized, so not artifact bytes.
        7. **exclude** — non-floating tensors (position ids, masks, integer
           lookup tables): not weights.
        8. **exclude** — 0-D/1-D floating tensors (norm scales, biases,
           rotary frequency tables): never a GEMM multiplicand; immutable
           floor bytes.
        9. **pin** — MoE router gates, matched by router-class family:
           the routing logits are matmul-fed but never priced (a route flip
           is not a smooth cost). DSv4's per-class pins predate this and
           keep their own reasons; this rule covers every other family the
           R5 sweep found (hy_v3, qwen3_5, laguna, minimax_m2, qwen3-moe)
           plus name-excluded Linear routers (gemma4).
        10. **decide** — packed expert stacks on an ``*Experts`` owner:
            priced through the packed-expert Fisher path, so they are
            allocator decisions like any other unit.
        11. **decide** — every remaining ``nn.Linear`` weight (subclasses
            included, matched through the MRO): the allocator's domain.

        Override to extend, not to weaken: profiles append architecture
        rules (or prepend more specific ones) and return the base list for
        everything the architecture does not special-case. A profile that
        removes rule 8 turns every Linear into a walk failure, which is loud
        by design.
