Scaffolding profile, built 2026-08-26 against the real checkpoint at
``/mnt/shared/models/GLM-5.3-Flash`` and transformers 5.16.1
(``/home/rob/dq-runs/venvs/prismaquant-tf516``). Every naming claim below is
cited to modeling code ``file:line`` or to a checkpoint index key; nothing is
carried over from a sibling architecture. The companion structure spec is
``specs/glm5_next.json``; the reconnaissance memo (full tensor inventory,
FP8/BF16 source map, open blockers, registration snippet) is
``/home/rob/dq-runs/coordination/glm5next-structure-recon-2026-08-26.md``.

Shape of the model (config.json ``text_config``)
------------------------------------------------
45 decoder layers + one body-indexed nextn/MTP block at index 45.

* ``layer_types``: 34 ``linear_attention`` (KDA) layers and 11
  ``deepseek_sparse_attention`` (MLA + indexer) layers at 3, 7, 11, ... 43.
  Layer 45 (MTP) is also MLA.
* ``mlp_layer_types``: layers 0-2 dense (``first_k_dense_replace: 3``),
  layers 3-44 (and 45) MoE with 288 routed experts top-8 plus one shared
  expert.
* MLA is NoPE (``qk_rope_head_dim: 0``, ``mla_use_nope: true``) with
  ``q_lora_rank 1536`` / ``kv_lora_rank 512``.
* Manifold-constrained hyper-connections (``mhc: true``, ``hc_mult: 4``) put
  two ``Glm5NextTextHyperConnection`` mixers on every body layer.

Per-layer-kind Linear inventory (modeling_glm5_next.py)
-------------------------------------------------------
KDA / ``Glm5NextTextLinearAttention`` (:584) — 9 Linears + 1 Conv1d:
  ``q_proj`` (:603), ``k_proj`` (:604), ``v_proj`` (:605),
  ``conv1d`` (:608, ``nn.Conv1d``, depthwise),
  ``forget_gate.f_a_proj``/``f_b_proj`` (:312-313),
  ``b_proj`` (:618), ``g_a_proj`` (:620), ``g_b_proj`` (:621),
  ``o_proj`` (:623).

MLA / ``Glm5NextTextAttention`` (:1064) — 5 Linears + a 3-Linear indexer:
  ``q_a_proj`` (:1098), ``q_b_proj`` (:1106),
  ``kv_a_proj_with_mqa`` (:1111), ``kv_b_proj`` (:1117), ``o_proj`` (:1123);
  ``indexer`` (:1131 -> :736) owns ``wq_b`` (:761), ``wk`` (:762),
  ``weights_proj`` (:764) plus two bare Parameters,
  ``index_kpool_compress_ape`` (:770) and ``index_kpool_compress_gate``
  (:771).

MLP — dense ``Glm5NextTextMLP`` (:86) ``gate_proj``/``up_proj``/``down_proj``
(:92-94); MoE ``Glm5NextTextMoE`` (:186) = ``experts``
(``Glm5NextTextExperts`` :108, 3-D ``gate_up_proj`` :116 / ``down_proj``
:117), ``gate`` (``Glm5NextTextTopkRouter`` :145, a bare
``nn.Parameter`` :151, not an ``nn.Linear``), and ``shared_experts``
(a ``Glm5NextTextMLP`` :196).

Three namespaces
----------------
* **source** — safetensors keys: ``model.language_model.layers.N.…``,
  ``model.visual.…``, ``lm_head.weight``.
* **live** — ``model.named_parameters()``. The only causal entrypoint is the
  multimodal wrapper ``Glm5NextForConditionalGeneration`` (:2063); there is
  **no** ``Glm5NextTextForCausalLM``, and ``Glm5NextModel.__init__`` (:1828)
  builds the vision tower unconditionally. So live names keep the
  ``model.language_model.`` infix in *both* staging modes, and
  ``checkpoint_to_live_name`` below deliberately does **not** strip it (the
  base implementation, base.py:1172, would).
* **recipe** — allocator keys: source spellings with the wrapper infix
  collapsed to ``model.`` (``live_to_recipe`` in the spec), matching the
  qwen3_5 convention.

Checkpoint -> live renames come from transformers' own conversion table
(``transformers/conversion_mapping.py``, ``"glm5_next"`` entry): the forget
gate gains an infix, and the hyper-connection parameters are re-spelled.
MLA and indexer projections are **not** renamed — unlike DeepSeek-V4, whose
entry maps ``wq_a`` -> ``q_a_proj``, glm5_next already ships live spellings.

FP8 source (see the spec's ``_verified_source_layout``)
-------------------------------------------------------
``quantization_config``: ``quant_method fp8``, ``fmt e4m3``,
``weight_block_size [128, 128]``, F32 ``.weight_scale_inv`` siblings — the
MiniMax/Qwen convention the **base** discovery path already handles. This
profile therefore does **not** override ``fp8_scale_pairs``; DSv4 only
overrides it because DSv4 ships 1-byte E8M0 ``.scale`` siblings instead.

The source dtype map is **per tensor, not per leaf name**: ``o_proj`` is
BF16 on the 34 KDA layers and FP8 on the 12 MLA layers (12 of 46
``o_proj.weight_scale_inv`` keys in the index). Since BF16 and FP8_SOURCE
are passthrough-only in this codebase, any leaf-keyed legality map would let
the allocator pick FP8_SOURCE for a BF16 KDA ``o_proj``. Keying on the
presence of the ``.weight_scale_inv`` sibling is the only correct rule here.

MTP / nextn
-----------
``num_nextn_predict_layers: 1``; the block is body-indexed at
``model.language_model.layers.45.`` and carries ``eh_proj``, ``enorm``,
``hnorm``, ``shared_head.norm`` plus a full MLA + MoE stack. transformers
5.16 refuses it outright (:1359 ``_keys_to_ignore_on_load_unexpected =
[r"layers\\.45\\.", r"layers\\.\\d+\\.shared_head\\."]``), so the skeleton
never instantiates it. This is the hy_v3 layout, not the ``mtp.*``-keyed
sidecar layout: ``has_mtp()`` stays False and the block ships VERBATIM via
``passthrough_prefixes``.

Quantizable vs pinned (principle 9 gate input)
-----------------------------------------------
The only vLLM serving path is PR #53906 (``ZJY0516/vllm@933876c``), and in
that model file **only routed experts, shared experts and dense MLPs are
constructed with a ``quant_config``**. MLA (``model.py:329
quant_config=None``), KDA (``kda.py:157-160`` nulls it for the whole
module), the indexer (``attention.py:251/:255``), the router
(``model.py:181 GateLinear`` takes no ``quant_config`` at all) and the
vision tower (``model.py:1032-1042``) are hardcoded unquantized. So the
quantizable set for artifact v1 is expert + shared-expert + dense-MLP
Linears; everything else is pinned or passthrough. Full per-class citations
live in ``specs/glm5_next.json``
``_verified_source_layout.serving_restriction``.

Mass split, measured over all 76,108 index keys and every shard header, in
the THREE buckets this profile creates (a ``.weight_scale_inv`` counts in
its weight's bucket):

===========================  ================  ==================
bucket                       params            source
===========================  ================  ==================
quantizable (BODY experts +
shared + dense MLP)          305,915,756,544   100% FP8
passthrough (layer 45
nextn/MTP + vision)            7,996,219,424   FP8 7.37e9
                                               BF16 0.62e9
pinned (everything else)       7,411,055,422   FP8 1.11e9
                                               BF16 6.30e9
total                        321,323,031,390
===========================  ================  ==================

95.21% of the parameter mass is quantizable. **Layer 45 is not**: it is a
full MoE block (288 routed + 1 shared expert, 7,272,923,136 params) that a
naive ``layers.\d+.mlp.`` regex would count as quantizable, but this
profile drops it in :meth:`checkpoint_to_live_name` and ships it verbatim at
FP8 source precision via ``passthrough_prefixes``. Whether the vLLM PR wires
``quant_config`` into ``Glm5NextMTP``'s experts is unattested (principle
14), so passthrough is the only defensible v1 line.

The immutable floor (pinned + passthrough at source precision) is
**20.80 GiB** = 12.77 pinned + 8.03 passthrough. It is a floor, not a budget
knob: 1.11e9 pinned and 7.37e9 passthrough params are FP8 on disk and
principle 11 forbids synthesizing BF16 from them. Whole-artifact weight
bytes ~= ``quantizable * bpp / 8 + 20.80 GiB`` (181.1 GiB at 4.50 bpp,
190.0 GiB at 4.75 bpp).

**Contradiction to resolve before export:** the PR's own comment at
``model.py:329`` reads *"MLA projections are BF16 in checkpoint"*. That is
false for this checkpoint — ``q_a_proj``, ``q_b_proj``,
``kv_a_proj_with_mqa`` and ``o_proj`` carry ``.weight_scale_inv`` on all 12
MLA layers and are ``F8_E4M3`` on disk; only ``kv_b_proj`` is BF16. Pinning
them therefore means FP8_SOURCE passthrough (~8.002 bpp), not BF16.

The KDA short convolution: a 3->1 concat, declared not hardcoded
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``self_attn.{q,k,v}_conv1d.weight`` -> ``self_attn.conv1d.weight`` is a 3->1
``Concatenate(dim=0)`` in the conversion table (34 layers x 3 = 102 source
keys, all BF16). ``checkpoint_to_live_name`` is a 1:1-or-drop contract and
cannot express a merge, so it passes the three source keys through unchanged
— exactly as it does for the per-expert MoE keys — and the merge itself is
declared in ``specs/glm5_next.json`` under ``concat_merges`` and executed by
the generic N->1 bridge ``layer_streaming._merge_concat_sources``, which
carries no architecture names. Order is load-bearing (q, k, v) and comes from
the conversion table; the bridge shape-checks the result against the live
parameter and refuses a dtype mix, so a wrong order or a missing source fails
loud rather than mis-packing. Left unbridged this was a hard blocker: the KDA
short convolution would have run on uninitialised weights.

Open, deliberately unimplemented (report, don't hack)
-----------------------------------------------------
1. ``vllm_architecture_class()`` returns None (DSv4/hy_v3 precedent) and
   ``fused_groups`` is empty. See the spec's ``open_todos.fused_groups``.
2. ``kv_b_proj`` is BF16 in the source while ``q_a``/``q_b``/``kv_a`` are
   FP8 — flagged in the memo as a serving-decision question, not decided
   here.
