"""Profile auto-detection + manual registration.

Usage:

    from prismaquant.model_profiles import detect_profile
    profile = detect_profile("/path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B")
    # profile is a Qwen3_5Profile instance.

External architectures can register their own profile at runtime:

    from prismaquant.model_profiles import register_profile, ModelProfile

    class MyArchProfile(ModelProfile):
        ...

    register_profile(MyArchProfile)

Registered profiles are consulted in `ModelProfile.priority` order (lower
first, ties broken by registration order); the first one whose `.matches()`
returns True wins. `DefaultProfile` is the terminal fallback when nothing
matches.

Two kinds of profile take part in detection:

  - **Python profiles** in `_REGISTERED`, matched by `cls.matches()`.
  - **Spec-only profiles** — a `SpecMatchProfile` per `specs/<id>.json` whose
    `id` no registered Python profile claims, matched by its declarative
    `match` block. This is the extension point that makes a pure-JSON
    architecture possible; while a Python profile of the same name exists it
    wins outright, so adding a spec never silently re-routes a shipped model.
