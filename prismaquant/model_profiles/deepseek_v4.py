"""DeepSeek-V4-Flash / -Flash-Base profile.

Covers:
  - DeepseekV4ForCausalLM as released in DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731: ~285 B params
    total by checkpoint arithmetic, of which 281,263,734,784 are quantizable
    across 33,325 probeable Linears (probe-measured 2026-08-02, 16x512
    diverse-v1); 43 layers, 256 routed + 1 shared expert, top-k=6, hybrid
    HCA/CSA attention with compressor + indexer, MTP head, hyper-connections,
    hash-routed first 3 MoE blocks. The 671 B figure that previously stood
    here is the DeepSeek-V3-family headline total and does not describe
    Flash; the DeepSeek family ships several differently-sized generations
    and variants, so size claims in this profile are per-checkpoint from the
    probe inventory, never the family headline.

The DSv4 checkpoint uses a non-standard naming convention compared to the
transformers `DeepseekV4Model` live module names. PrismaQuant must bridge
both directions:

  | live (transformers)                     | checkpoint (safetensors)             |
  |-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | model.embed_tokens.weight               | embed.weight                         |
  | model.norm.weight                       | norm.weight                          |
  | lm_head.weight                          | head.weight                          |
  | model.layers.N.self_attn.X              | layers.N.attn.X                      |
  | model.layers.N.self_attn.compressor.X   | layers.N.attn.compressor.X           |
  | model.layers.N.mlp.gate.weight          | layers.N.ffn.gate.weight             |
  | model.layers.N.mlp.experts.E.gate_proj  | layers.N.ffn.experts.E.w1            |
  | model.layers.N.mlp.experts.E.up_proj    | layers.N.ffn.experts.E.w3            |
  | model.layers.N.mlp.experts.E.down_proj  | layers.N.ffn.experts.E.w2            |
  | model.layers.N.mlp.shared_experts.X     | layers.N.ffn.shared_experts.X        |
  | model.layers.N.attn_hc.{base,fn,scale}  | layers.N.hc_attn_{base,fn,scale}     |
  | model.layers.N.ffn_hc.{base,fn,scale}   | layers.N.hc_ffn_{base,fn,scale}      |
  | model.mtp.0.X                           | mtp.0.X                              |

Also:
  - shared experts use HF-style `gate_proj`/`up_proj`/`down_proj` in live, but
    the checkpoint stores them as `w1`/`w2`/`w3` (Mixtral convention)
  - the vendored probe topology exposes routed experts as per-expert
    `nn.Linear` gate/up/down projections, matching the separately stored
    checkpoint rows; the serving/export profile groups and virtual-packs them
    as `gate_up_proj` (E, 2*I, H) and `down_proj` (E, H, I)

Important: vLLM main landed DSv4 support today (PR #40860). Once the
container is rebuilt, set `vllm_architecture_class()` to `"DeepseekV4ForCausalLM"`
to enable scheme-dispatch + packed-modules-mapping autoderivation. Until
then we run with `None` and the base class gracefully degrades.
