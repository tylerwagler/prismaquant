"""Preflight for the ``EXPORT_CONTAINER=tessera`` arm of ``run-pipeline.sh``.

The Tessera container is the third sanctioned lane (Rob, 2026-09-02:
compressed-tensors, GGUF, Tessera).  This module is the gate the arm runs
before it spends a single GPU-hour, and it is deliberately the same shape as
the R6 lane preflight two hundred lines above it in the driver: refuse up
front, against a machine-readable table, naming what has to change.

**PrismaQuant does not vendor the Tessera exporter.**  The boundary between
the two repositories crosses at exactly two objects -- the immutable pin
(``tessera_runtime/tessera_serving_runtime_pin.json``) and the contract the
plugin packages (``tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json``) -- and the lane
spec's established pattern for everything else is to NAME a Tessera-repository
tool rather than copy it (``lane_specs/tessera.json`` already names the serve
script and the route census that way).  The arm follows it: the layer_config
to plan translation is Tessera's ``experiments/plan_from_layer_config.py`` and
the encode is Tessera's ``experiments/export_tessera_serving.py``.  Copying
either here would make this repository the second place a wire recipe lives,
which is the failure mode principle 14 exists to prevent.

**Independent fail-closed gates, before encoding.**

1. :func:`require_release_pin` -- the INSTALLED Tessera must be the exact
   pinned one: the pin's commit and the SHA-256 of the packaged
   ``runtime_contract.json`` the run actually imports.  Since 2026-09-04 that
   is what immutability rests on -- Rob retired the release-tag requirement
   ("can we just pin prismaquant to latest version of tessera? then we won't
   have to keep cutting releases"), and a digest is a stronger claim than a
   tag because a tag can be moved and a stray tree cannot be hashed into
   agreement.  This refuses release exports regardless of whether development
   admission is enabled, and says so where an operator can act on it rather
   than as ``unknown export lane`` from a vocabulary check three layers up.
2. :func:`require_executes_derived_from_contract` -- principle 14.  The lane
   spec's ``served_activation_quantization.executes`` states what the serving
   runtime EXECUTES, so it is DERIVED from the ``formats[]`` table the runtime
   publishes and any disagreement refuses.  Two of our own spec files once
   disagreed about one runtime; the runtime was never ambiguous.
3. :func:`require_declared_structure` -- the checkpoint's structural class
   must be declared by the packaged contract. This is a coarse preflight,
   not permission to treat every unit of an MoE checkpoint as an expert.
4. :func:`require_producer_tools` -- every external tool the lane DECLARES it
   shells out to must exist under the env var the declaration names.  This was
   a hardcoded ``for`` loop over two paths in ``run-pipeline.sh``; it is now
   read from ``lane_specs/tessera.json``'s ``producer_tools``, which also
   carries each tool's stability and its tracking issue, so a shipping lane's
   dependency on a script with no stability promise is a value a reader and a
   gate can both see (RobTand/prismaquant#119).
5. :func:`require_producer_repo_is_pinned` -- the checkout those tools come
   from must be the SAME Tessera the pin attests: the
   ``runtime_contract.json`` it packages must hash to the pin's
   ``contract_sha256``.  Gate 1 hashes the package this process *imports*;
   without this one a run could satisfy the pin with one Tessera while a
   different checkout WROTE the wire, which is principle 8's split-brain.
6. :func:`require_serving_target` and :func:`require_assignment_scope` -- a
   scoped (v5 or later) contract
   needs an explicit runtime target. Before translation, every selected
   Tessera unit must retain the allocation's target and per-unit context,
   agree with the source header and profile topology, and resolve all regimes
   on that context. Legacy calls without scope retain their existing gates.
   This gate also RECORDS one thing it deliberately does not refuse: whether
   the routed-expert bytes come from the campaign's priced wires or are
   re-encoded from source (:data:`ROUTED_EXPERT_BYTES_KEY`, #222). Both lanes
   are sanctioned -- a carried producer projection is an unlock, not a
   requirement (#183, #220) -- but which one shipped is a fact about the
   artifact, so it is a field in the receipt rather than a difference a
   consumer has to infer.
7. :func:`require_priced_export_inputs` -- the inputs the allocation was
   PRICED under must be the inputs the exporter is handed
   (RobTand/prismaquant#193): an H-aware allocation needs its identity-matched
   Hessian capture, a weights-only allocation refuses a stray one, and a W4A4
   selection needs a static ``input_global_scale`` for every selected unit.
   Numbered seventh because it merged beside gate 5 on separate branches;
   ``preflight`` runs it after the assignment hash and before the scope walk.
