"""allocator.py — multi-choice knapsack mixed-precision assignment.

Given:
  - per-Linear empirical Fisher diagonal trace (from sensitivity_probe.py)
  - per-(Linear, format) measured quantization cost (from measure_quant_cost.py)
  - a bit budget (target average bits per parameter)
  - a format registry (any subset of registered formats)

Solve for a per-Linear format assignment that minimizes total predicted
loss increase subject to the bit budget.

Derivation of the per-(layer, format) predicted loss term
---------------------------------------------------------
Let L be the per-token loss (negative log-likelihood). Quantizing layer
ℓ's weight tensor W by ΔW = W_q - W produces a perturbed loss whose
expectation under the calibration distribution admits the standard
second-order expansion:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · ΔW · F · ΔWᵀ                         (1)

where F is the Fisher information matrix of L w.r.t. W. Replacing F by
its diagonal (the standard HAWQ-V1 simplification) and approximating
F_ww by the empirical Fisher diagonal F̂_ww = E_token[(∂L/∂W_w)²]:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · Σ_w F̂_ww · (ΔW_w)²                   (2)

Under the further assumption that the per-weight quantization error
(ΔW_w)² and the per-weight Fisher diagonal F̂_ww are uncorrelated across
w (which is the same assumption HAWQ already makes when it summarizes a
layer by a single scalar), this collapses to the product of two
per-layer scalars:

    E[ΔL] ≈ 0.5 · H_trace · MSE_W                       (3)

where
    H_trace = Σ_w F̂_ww            (per-token Fisher diagonal trace)
    MSE_W   = (1/n_w) · Σ_w (ΔW_w)²

Both quantities are produced by upstream stages:
    H_trace ← sensitivity_probe.py / FisherAccumulator (`h_trace`)
    MSE_W   ← measure_quant_cost.py (per-(layer, format) `weight_mse`)

So we use eq. (3) directly. There is no `* d_out` factor; the previous
implementation carried one but it does not appear in the derivation —
it was a holdover from an earlier output-side formulation that mixed
units and was off by a per-layer multiplicative constant that varies
with d_out.

For MoE experts an additional route-probability normalization is folded
into H_trace inside the probe so that sparsely-routed experts' Fisher
contributions are on the same per-token footing as dense layers'.

Solver:
  Multi-choice knapsack via DP with bit-budget discretization (we round
  bit costs to 0.001-bit bins). For 35B with ~300 Linears × 8 formats ×
  ~5000 budget bins, runtime is under 1s.

Fused-projection siblings (q/k/v/o, gate/up, ...) are post-processed:
  all siblings promoted to the highest format chosen for any of them,
  to match vLLM's fused-tensor loader constraints. Since promotion can
  push achieved bits past the requested budget, the DP is re-run with a
  tightened target until achieved is within tolerance.

Optional empirical calibration:
  If `--calibration` points at a JSON containing
  `calibrated_gains[fmt] = α_fmt`, the predicted Δloss for format f is
  multiplied by α_f before the DP runs. The historical tiny-bakeoff
  producer for this payload is archived; production recipes normally run
  uncalibrated and validate assignments with direct KL measurement.

Auto-Pareto knee via Kneedle (Satopää et al.). The primary recommendation
uses a post-cliff log-error knee: when the frontier spans multiple orders of
magnitude, the first half of the log-error range is treated as the
catastrophic region and Kneedle is applied to the remaining operational
frontier. The global log-error and raw-linear knees are still reported as
diagnostics. (We implement Kneedle here rather than depend on the `kneed`
PyPI package because the post-cliff log-error variant — trimming the
catastrophic prefix before applying the knee — has no equivalent in `kneed`,
and the curve is tiny so the dependency would not pay for itself.)

# sensitivity signal to allocate on. Rather than let every visual Linear
# default to the cheapest format or go through stale passthrough, we accept
# a single uniform target format (`BF16`, `NVFP4`, or `FP8_DYNAMIC`) and assign
# every visual Linear to it. BF16 (the default) reproduces the previous
# passthrough behavior; quantized formats shrink the tower to quantized
# storage using the same math the body gets.
#
# Phase 2 (tracked separately) will replace this override with a real
# multimodal Fisher: load images + text, run full forward through the
# visual encoder → projector → body LM, capture per-Linear empirical Fisher
# gradients, and feed those into the allocator's closed-form Δloss. That
# requires a multimodal dataset loader, multimodal tokenizer wiring, and a
# probe path that doesn't strip the visual tower — none of which ship in

    n_tokens_seen` PER ROW, where per-expert Linears only count their
    ROUTED tokens — inflating a rarely-routed expert's Fisher by
    (global/routed), i.e. inverted importance weighting. The typical
    inflation is ~n_experts/top_k (≈32x on a 256-expert top-8 model);
    the degenerate 1-routed-token case reaches ~33,000x at a 32k-token
    calibration. Dense rows saw exactly the global count, so their values
    are unchanged; probes written by the fixed finalize renormalize to
    identical values — the recompute is idempotent (see PER-ROW STAMPS).

    PER-ROW STAMPS WIN. A row that already carries ``h_trace_norm_tokens``
    was written by a fixed finalize (the field was introduced with it) and
    is already divided by the global count of the pass that PRODUCED it —
    which is not always this probe's meta count. `incremental_probe` merges
    the multimodal visual pass (finalized at ``n_samples x max_text_len``,
    e.g. 8x128) into the body probe, and `merge_probe_pickles` keeps the
    FIRST shard's meta (the body's, e.g. 32x1024), so recomputing every row
    from the meta count would rescale the visual rows by ~32x away from
    what their writer computed — and would not be idempotent. Honouring the
    row stamp keeps each row on its own writer's denominator and makes the
    recompute a true no-op for any probe written by the fixed finalize.

    Returns the probe-wide token count (the meta fallback used for
    unstamped rows), or None when nothing could be renormalized. A row
    with raw accumulators, no stamp, and no usable meta count is a HARD
    ERROR (SystemExit) — silently allocating on routed-token-normalized
    Fisher mis-spends the bit budget; `allow_legacy=True`
    (--allow-legacy-fisher-norm) downgrades it to a warning and keeps the
    probe's stored h_trace values.

            The Pareto grid is a COARSE SAMPLE of the RD curve, but the

            allocation". That reading holds only while the grid actually
            reaches the bottom of the format menu, and ``--pareto-targets``
            defaults to 4.5..8.25 — a range written for a 4-bit/8-bit menu.
            On the CB menu (NVFP4-CB is ~2.03 bpp) every sampled point is
            more than twice as dense as the operator's budget, so a budget
            the menu can meet with room to spare is rejected as "below the

            a 92.0 GB budget whose menu floor is 87.2 GB was reported
