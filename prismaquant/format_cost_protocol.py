"""The costing seam: turn a Sensitivity Card + a format into an allocator candidate.

WHERE THIS SITS
---------------
``allocator_solver.py`` already defines the entire contract the optimizer needs::

    @dataclass
    class Candidate:
        fmt: str
        bits_per_param: float
        memory_bytes: int
        predicted_dloss: float

and the scalar model that fills the last field::

    def predicted_dloss(h_trace, weight_mse, gain=1.0) -> float:
        return 0.5 * float(h_trace) * float(weight_mse) * float(gain)

This module does not replace that seam -- it *feeds* it. A format plugin turns
``(SensitivityUnit, W, FormatDescriptor)`` into a :class:`CostComponents`, and
:meth:`CostComponents.to_predicted_dloss` collapses that to the one float the
knapsack DP consumes. The optimizer is untouched, so an arbitrary format menu
becomes an arbitrary list of plugins rather than a change to the solver.

THE THREE COST MODELS, IN INCREASING FIDELITY
---------------------------------------------
1. ``SCALAR`` -- ``0.5 * h_trace * weight_mse``. Exactly today's behaviour, and
   the fallback when a card carries no vectors. Reproducing this byte-identically
   from a card is the primary acceptance test for this module: same formula,
   same inputs, so any drift is a bug and not a modelling choice.

2. ``MARGINAL`` -- weight error weighted by the per-channel Fisher marginals
   instead of by a single scalar. The scalar model is the rank-0 collapse of the
   same object; this is the rank-1 reconstruction. It is strictly more
   descriptive per unit and costs ``out + in`` floats.

3. ``AQUA`` -- adds an activation-quantization term so that W4A4 and W4A8 stop
   being the same candidate. See below.

AQUA-AURA: WHY THE A-SIDE NEEDS ITS OWN SENSITIVITY
---------------------------------------------------
``h_trace`` is a *weight-space* curvature. An activation-quantization error is
an *input-side* perturbation ``x -> x + dx``, which reaches the loss as
``dy = W dx``. Multiplying an input-side error by a weight-space sensitivity is
a currency error of exactly the kind ``activation_fair_pricing.py`` is the
autopsy of, so this module refuses to do it.

Under a diagonal model the output perturbation is::

    E||W dx||^2 = sum_j  var(dx_j) * ||W[:, j]||^2

and it becomes a loss delta through the OUTPUT-space Fisher ``g_sq_sum[o]``::

    dLoss_a ~= 0.5 * sum_o  g_sq[o] * (W[o, :]^2 . var_dx)

which is what :func:`activation_dloss` computes. Note this uses ``g_sq_sum``,
never ``h_trace``.

STATUS: the A-side term is a **screening surrogate**. It is research-tier until
a served W4A4-vs-W4A8 A/B exists. ``activation_fair_pricing.py`` is deliberately
left untouched: superseding it is a promotion decision on evidence, not a
drive-by refactor.

WHAT THIS MODULE REFUSES TO DO
------------------------------
- Sum costs measured in different currencies (raises).
- Apply a passthrough format to a unit whose source dtype does not already match
  (BF16/FP8_SOURCE are passthrough-only; synthesising them wastes 8 bpp).
- Invent a speed/quality scalarization constant. Speed and quality are returned
  as separate axes; the choice between them is a frontier selection, not a
  weighted sum.

    :func:`uniform_act_quant_variance` sets the step from ``act_absmax[j]`` --
    the largest value channel ``j`` reached over the WHOLE calibration. That is
    right for a per-tensor/per-channel grid and wrong for every format in the
    shipped menu, because NVFP4 (G=16) and MX (G=32) rescale *per block, per
    token*: the step follows the local block maximum, which is far below the
    global one. Pricing a block-scaled quantizer with a global step therefore
    OVER-states its error, and it does so asymmetrically -- it penalises exactly
    the W4A4 formats, herding the allocator toward W4A8 for a modelling reason
    rather than a measured one.

    The step is set by the expected within-block maximum, which
    :func:`_expected_blockmax_sq` computes exactly from the per-channel scales
    ``sigma_j^2 = act_sq_sum[j] / n_tokens``. The familiar ``sqrt(2 ln 2G)``
    asymptotic is deliberately NOT used: at the block sizes that actually ship
    it is wrong by +52% (G=16) and +46% (G=32) against a 400k-sample
    simulation, and its standard Fisher-Tippett correction only turns that into
    -14%. An exact expression exists, so per the no-heuristics rule the exact
    expression is what runs.

    ASSUMPTIONS, all of which degrade gracefully and none of which are hidden:

    * **Gaussian and independent within a block.** Real activations are heavy
      tailed and correlated across channels. A heavy tail makes the true block
      max *larger* than this estimate, so the model is optimistic there -- the
      opposite direction to the uniform model's pessimism, and far smaller in
      magnitude. Per-channel heterogeneity is NOT an assumption: it is carried
      exactly.
    * **Dynamic, per-token block scales.** This prices what NVFP4/MX kernels do
      at serve time. A statically calibrated activation grid would be closer to
      :func:`uniform_act_quant_variance`, and a format declaring one should say
      so by leaving ``act_group_size`` unset.
    * **The block scale is treated as exact.** NVFP4 snaps it to FP8 and MX to a
      power of two; that quantization of the scale itself is second order and is
      not modelled here.

    Returns ``None`` when the card carries no ``act_sq_sum`` -- the block model
    needs per-channel *scales*, and ``act_absmax`` alone cannot supply them
    without re-introducing the global-max error this function exists to remove.
