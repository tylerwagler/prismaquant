"""Render a Linear through Tessera, in the shape the production cache wants.

The render contract PrismaQuant already has is exactly the one Tessera needs:
``render_production_weight(weight, fmt, qname=...)`` returns a **dequantized
weight of the same shape and dtype**, and every stage downstream -- the AURA
cost, the allocator's per-(Linear, format) price, the real-KL validation, the
exported bytes -- is defined against that tensor.  So a Tessera rung becomes a
first-class allocator candidate the moment encode->decode is reachable from a
format name.  No export path and no serving backend are required to price it,
which is the point: the measurement that decides whether Tessera is worth a
vLLM backend can be taken before the backend exists.

**Rungs are family parameters, not registry entries.**  ``tessera_formats``
states this deliberately -- a family addresses ~9500 rungs at 1/256-bpp
resolution, and materialising those as static ``REGISTRY`` rows would turn a
continuous rate axis into a menu someone has to maintain.  So the specs are
*synthesized on demand* from the name, and ``format_registry.get_format`` falls
back here for anything Tessera-shaped.  Every existing consumer that resolves a
format by name keeps working, unchanged.

**Nothing here reimplements Tessera.**  The grid, the rate schedule, the
forests, the Viterbi and the reconstruction all come from the ``tessera``
package; this module is the adapter and holds no numeric constant of its own.
A second copy of a rate constant is a drift bug waiting for a rate to change.

    Returns ``(attested, reason)``.  ``reason`` is empty when the answer is
    True and otherwise names **which conjunct refused**, because "unattested"
    alone is four different facts and a menu that reports the wrong one sends
    a reader to fix the wrong thing.  :func:`tessera_lane_attested` is the
    boolean half; nothing may re-derive the reason beside this body.

    Principle 9 makes this a *measured platform fact*, and principle 14 says
    the fact is read from the runtime's own table, never asserted here.  The
    runtime is Tessera's own vLLM plugin (``tessera.serving``, entry point
    ``tessera``, selected by a checkpoint's ``quant_method: "tessera"``, one
    operator knob ``TESSERA_SERVE_MODE``), and the table is the
    ``runtime_contract.json`` that plugin packages.  Five conjuncts, each of
    which fails closed on its own:

    1. **The table admits the rung.**  The contract publishes the name's
       payload family (``TESSERA_E2M1_K2`` for ``TESSERA_E2M1_K2_R896``) and
       carries a ``device_qualified`` cell whose route executes natively and
       whose ``rungs_q256`` names this rate. V5 additionally requires every
       regime within the caller's explicit platform, structure, residency,
       runtime image and execution mode; v3/v4 retain their legacy lookup. No
       table, an unpublished family, a rate no cell names, a ``compile_only``
       cell or a ``fallback`` route all answer False.
    2. **Every matching cell states its plugin requirement.**  Stock vLLM has
       no reader for these bytes, so a Tessera route is plugin-gated rather
       than merely flag-gated, and the cell says so in a field a gate can read
       (``requires_plugin``).  A cell that claims a route while naming no
       plugin is a CONTRACT DEFECT, and this function RAISES rather than
       admitting it: silently admitting would produce an artifact whose serve
       command need not install the runtime that reads it.  The requirement is
       carried into provenance by
       ``lane_eligibility.resolve_unit_route``, which aggregates it
       onto every ``UnitRoute`` / ``RegimeRoute`` (``requires_plugins``) and
       into ``EligibilityTable.provenance()`` (``required_plugins``) -- the
       payload the export gate stamps.
    3. **The installed runtime is the exact pinned one.**  Without this
       conjunct the answer would flip to True the moment the ``tessera``
       package became importable -- which it already is, as a producer-side
       render dependency -- and a producer-side import is not an attested
       serving runtime.  Since 2026-09-04 the pin is a commit plus the
       packaged contract's SHA-256 rather than a release tag, so
       ``require_pinned_tessera_runtime`` admits exactly the Tessera whose
       ``runtime_contract.json`` hashes to
       ``TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_CONTRACT_SHA256`` and refuses every
       other tree on ``PYTHONPATH`` -- **eligibility is decided by the pin,
       not by an edit here**.
    4. **The cell's own evidence admits it.**  A cell whose packaged
       ``evidence.smoke.status`` records a degenerate greedy smoke is refused
       by ``lane_eligibility.cell_evidence_admits``: the runtime measured this
       route generating incorrectly, and principle 9 requires a route to
       generate correctly.  That is a refusal the runtime attested, not a
       structural ban this file typed; when the runtime records a clean smoke
       the refusal lifts on its own and the re-pin is the review event.
    5. **The lane the cell launches through can read this producer's plan.**
       Since contract v20 every ``native_extensions`` row publishes the
       predicate its kernel gates on (``lane.requires``: the column rates,
       window width, body, plane and decoration it reads), and a cell's
       ``executes`` names the lane launch only for the rungs the ATTESTED
       wire reaches.  This producer's plan at the rung is not that stamp --
       it is :func:`planned_wire_facts`, read off the recipe and decoration
       the render encodes with -- so ``lane_eligibility.cell_lane_admits``
       hands those facts to Tessera's own decision core
       (``tessera.serving.scheme.decide_lane_requirements``, the one home of
       the rule) and refuses the cell by name when the kernel would refuse
       the bytes.  Nothing here restates the predicate: a lane that widens
       or narrows what it reads is a re-pin, not an edit.

    This is the scoped menu-level admission, one lookup. Per-unit structural
    predicates stay with ``lane_eligibility.resolve_unit_route`` at export.

    History: until 2026-09-02 this was a module constant (``False``), then a
    lookup against GRIDBOOK's serving pin, whose unreleased contract v13/v14
    carried the Tessera rows.  Gridbook's Tessera lane is withdrawn and the
    Gridbook pin no longer governs Tessera admission.

    **Derived, not restated.**  The answer is whether the pinned
    ``ActivationSource`` emits an H-bearing keyword -- ``ldl`` or
    ``refit_metric`` -- for the plane this rung's recipe resolves to.  If it
    emits neither, the H-aware encode and the weights-only encode are the same
    bytes and pricing it weights-only is pricing what ships.  If it emits
    either, they are not, and a weights-only price is a price of bytes the
    exporter will not write.

    This used to restate Tessera's condition -- "the CHANNEL scale plane, and
    only it, at ``f3e7d0a``" -- quoting two refusals verbatim:

    * ``ldl`` -- "LDLQ is implemented for the CHANNEL scale plane; a block
      plane's per-column-span scales would have to be scheduled with it"
    * ``refit_metric`` -- "read only by the CHANNEL plane's refit"

    **Tessera deleted both guards on 2026-09-02**
    (``docs/measurements/tessera-ldlq-lut-plane-served-2026-09-02.md``: "That
    reason does not survive reading the loop it guards"), and the restatement
    went stale where nothing could see it.  ``refit_metric`` is now refused
    only on S6b, ``ldl`` on no plane at all, and the same release keyed the
    refit objective **by** plane -- which is the ``scale_plane`` argument
    ``for_unit`` now demands.  One relaxation, two symptoms.

    What the staleness cost: on the LUT plane the H-aware wire is measured at
    served KL 0.5310 against the weights-only wire's 0.6404 on Qwen3-0.6B at
    the E2M1x2 q896 cap, at **identical bytes** (both 220,301,312 wire bytes,
    4.0018 bpp).  PrismaQuant priced and rendered every E2M1 rung weights-only
    while its own export lane hands the encode to Tessera's exporter
    (``experiments/export_tessera_serving.py:633``), which applies
    ``for_unit(..., scale_plane=recipe.scale_plane)`` on every plane whenever a
    Hessian is supplied.  The surrogate was pricing bytes the export does not
    write -- principle 8, across the repository boundary.

    ``recipe`` is the resolved wire the encode itself uses, threaded rather
    than looked up again: ``_recipe_for`` is memoised and a
    ``clear_recipe_cache`` between two lookups (tests do this) is exactly the
    split that would let the price and the encode disagree.

    One residual plane guard is Tessera's alone and is deliberately not
    mirrored here: ``refit_reach_floor`` is CHANNEL-only, and the source
    default is ``False``, so it reaches a block plane only when a caller turns
    it on -- at which point Tessera raises by name, which is the runtime
    speaking for itself rather than this module speaking for it.

    ``test_the_hessian_applies_exactly_where_tessera_says_it_does`` pins the
    derivation against real encodes on every family, each built with its own
    resolved plane: the predicate and the raise site agree, or the test fails.

    Every PrismaQuant price of a Tessera rung goes through here, so that what

    would ship are one encode with one set of inputs (principle 8).  The render
    returned is ``read_unit_artifact(blob)`` -- the bytes, decoded -- not a
    second reconstruction that happens to agree.

    ``activation_kwargs`` is what ``tessera_hessian.encoder_kwargs`` returned
    for THIS unit **on this rung's scale plane**: the block-LDL of its
    regularised ``XᵀX`` and the plane's refit metric.  They carry no rate, so
    they arrive pre-computed rather than as a Hessian this function would
    re-factorise once per rate; they do carry a plane, so the caller memoises
    them per ``(unit, plane)`` and not per unit.

    ``recipe`` is the resolved wire, threaded from the caller so that the
    plane the kwargs were built on, the plane the predicate reads, and the
    plane the encode writes are one object rather than three lookups.  Omit it
    and this resolves its own; the two agree today because ``_recipe_for`` is
    memoised, and disagree the moment anything clears that cache between two
    lookups -- which is exactly what ``clear_recipe_cache`` exists for and
    what the tests do.

    **The invariant that makes "the same recipe" true across the boundary:**
    the only keywords forwarded to ``encode_linear`` are ``grid``/``q256``/
    ``name``/``verify`` plus the set ``ActivationSource.for_unit`` emits, and
    anything else is refused below by name.  No recipe axis -- ``span``,
    ``scale_plane``, ``body``, ``window_bits`` -- can reach the encoder from
    here, so Tessera resolves the recipe internally with no override and its
    answer equals ``tessera_wire_recipe(family, rung)`` by value.  That
    equality is what the refusal in ``for_unit`` is warning about, and it
    holds because the whitelist is structural rather than because a caller
    remembered.

    ``hessian_required=True`` is the default for the same reason
    ``render_production_weight`` defaults ``ldlq_missing_activation_ok=False``:
    a render that quietly drops its activation input prices a different tensor
    than the one that ships, and does so silently.  Pass ``False`` to price
    weights-only *deliberately*; the caller must then stamp that on every row.

    """The production render for a Tessera rung: **decoded wire bytes**.

    ``render_production_weight`` reaches this before its format cascade, so a
    ``TESSERA_*`` unit in a ``layer_config`` renders through Tessera's encoder
    rather than falling to the registry's weights-only ``quantize_dequantize``
    reconstruction.  Two things were wrong with that fallback and both are
    silent: it is a reconstruction rather than the bytes, and it is
    weights-only, while the encoder's shipping default is H-aware.  Principle 8
    wants the surrogate, the KL validation and the shipped bytes to be *one*
    render; this is the function that makes that true for Tessera.

    The Hessian is ``XᵀX`` over ``activations[qname]`` -- PrismaQuant's own
    calibration rows, the same cache the AURA probe reads, never the held-out
    split the KL selection uses -- formed by ``tessera_hessian.
    hessian_from_rows``, the same function the anchor campaign calls, so the
    two paths cannot form it two ways.  A **missing** ``qname`` is a hard
    failure, not a fallback: the recurring landmine in this codebase is a
    render whose activation lookup misses by a key and silently prices RTN.

    The draw's identity rides in ``levers['tessera_hessian_identity']`` and is
    **required**: an ``ActivationSource`` refuses a provenance missing
    ``text_sha256`` / ``fit_tokens`` / ``fit_ids_sha256``, and that refusal is
    what makes "the campaign priced this rung and the cache rendered it" a
    checkable claim rather than an assumption. Whoever fills the activation
    cache stamps the triple; there is no default, because an identity of
    ``None`` compares equal to another ``None``.

    ``levers['tessera_weights_only']`` is the deliberate opt-out and must be
    stamped by whoever sets it.
