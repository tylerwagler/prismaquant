"""Reference :class:`FormatCostPlugin` implementations backed by the real registry.

These are not a parallel model of what a format does -- they call
``FormatSpec.quantize_dequantize`` and ``FormatSpec.activation_quantize_dequantize``
directly, so the error a plugin reports is produced by the same code that
renders. That is the same rendering-identity requirement that makes the
surrogate, the KL validation and the exported bytes comparable; a plugin that
re-implemented a format's rounding would reintroduce exactly the confound the
"one cache mechanism" rule exists to prevent.

Because the registry already declares ``act_bits`` and
``act_quant_changes_input`` per format, AQUA-AURA needs no new format metadata:
``NVFP4`` (W4A4) and ``NVFP4A16`` (W4A16) are already distinct entries with
identical weight bits, which is the cleanest possible demonstration that the
activation term is doing the work.

The activation error is *measured* through the format's own activation
quantizer, applied to a synthetic activation whose per-channel scale is taken
from the card, rather than assumed to be a uniform grid. Caveat, stated plainly:
real activation quantizers are often per-token or per-group, so driving them
with a per-channel synthetic sample approximates the grouping. This is a
screening surrogate, not a served measurement.

        WHY THIS EXISTS. Both quantities the coster needs are REDUCTIONS of the
        elementwise squared error, and :meth:`weight_error` returns that error as
        a dense ``[out, in]`` fp32 array on the HOST. For a body Linear that is a
        356 MB round trip; for a large-vocab ``lm_head`` (248320 x 5120) it is
        5.08 GB, and ``price`` then builds several more arrays of that shape in
        float64 to reduce it. On GB10, where the GPU and host share one physical
        pool, those transients are what actually exhaust the box -- and they do
        it INVISIBLY to host RSS, because CUDA device memory is not charged to
        the process. Measured: an 89M-param unit settles at 9.8 GiB reserved, so
        `lm_head` at 14x that scale has no chance.

        The fix is to keep the reduction on the device and stream it in row
        chunks. Peak device memory becomes ``w + q`` (bf16, so 2 bytes each) plus
        one chunk, instead of five dense fp32 copies. It is also markedly faster:
        the dense path was bus- and host-bound, which is why the GPU sat at low
        utilization during costing -- exactly the "launch-overhead-bound, 96% at
        11 W" signature this codebase warns about.

        CRITICALLY, ``quantize_dequantize`` still runs on the WHOLE tensor. Only
        the reduction is chunked. Formats whose scales are computed per tensor
        (rather than per group along the input axis) would otherwise see a
        different scale per chunk and silently render something the exporter
        never ships -- a rendering confound, which is the one thing the "one
        cache mechanism" rule exists to prevent.

        Accumulation is float64 for both outputs, so the only difference from the
        dense path is summation ORDER, at fp64 precision. Returns ``None`` for a
        passthrough format (exactly zero error by construction) and when the card
        carries no marginals, letting the caller keep its existing fallbacks.
