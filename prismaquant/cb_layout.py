"""Torch-free source of truth for the retired Gridbook CB serialized layout.

This module owns producer-side facts that used to be repeated by the format
registry, layer-config parser, packer, and exact byte accountant.  Gridbook was
an intentionally independent consumer implementation, and until 2026-09-02 a
cross-repository CI job compared its packaged runtime contract with these
values field by field.  The lane was retired that day
(archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/) and the job went with it
(.github/workflows/ci.yml); the layout is kept so persisted CB assignments
still parse and price, but no exporter writes it and no sanctioned lane
serves it.

#
# It was already excluded from production allocation by the serving profile's
# format rule -- research-only after losing 78.48% of matched weight-MSE
# comparisons -- so no shipped artifact and no allocation on disk references an

# The durable reason it can never come back without new kernels: Gridbook's
# native FP4 path is written against the UNSIGNED two-tier product layout and
# tests for it exactly -- ``is_fp4 and is_v2 and n_sub == 2 and
# type_size == 4*k + 9`` (gridbook ``linear.py::_require_fp4_v2_product``).
# A signed n_sub=1 rung has decode support in older kernels but "no native
# quality-preserving dense prefill kernel", and it trips the v2 GEMV's own
# ``cb_elems`` check (gridbook ``moe_gemv_select.py:307``). Serving it would
# mean one layer changing numeric implementation with batch size.
