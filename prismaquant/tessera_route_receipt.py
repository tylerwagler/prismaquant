"""The priced-vs-served route gate for the Tessera lane (#136, Tessera #126).

Scoped census v2 retains the producer's complete observations and exact input
texts. Its replay binds price projections to the independent card build and
artifact sidecars, then compares each owner's actual launch to the current
scoped cells (``LANE_ELIGIBILITY_SCHEMA_TESSERA``) at the exact
image/mode/residency. A decoder used as a dense fallback
may be a legitimate routed-MoE launch only where that cell explicitly says so.
There is no global substitute veto for scoped rows. Legacy flat rows below
retain the historical v4 check and can never acquire fabricated scope.

Tessera's runtime contract publishes, per native extension, what a serve
does when the ``.so`` cannot build (``native_extensions[].when_unavailable``,
contract v7): resident mode keeps serving on a NAMED substitute decoder and
stamps it on every route record.  The field exists so "a receipt must never
claim the native decoder for a serve that took the" fallback -- but nothing
in PrismaQuant read it, so a shipcard could price ``TESSERA_NVFP4`` W4A4
while a serve produced every number on ``torch_materialize_stock`` with
nothing refusing.

The legacy path reads historical ``{route, decoder}`` row arrays. The
current producer tool remains Tessera-owned (``lane_specs/tessera.json``),
and its complete v2 object must use the scoped path above. The legacy
comparison refuses on:

* no records at all (an absent census is not a clean bill);
* any record without a decoder (a decoder-less row read as native is the
  hole that existed before this gate);
* any record whose decoder is a KNOWN substitute -- derived from the pinned
  contract's ``when_unavailable`` via
  :func:`substitute_decoders_from_contract_answer`, never hardcoded here;
* served-vs-priced route disagreement in either direction (a number whose
  units rode a route other than the one they were priced on is not a
  result).

Stdlib only, no torch: the shipcard replays this at publication through
``prismaquant.shipcard``, which is stdlib-only by contract.

What the legacy path does not do: its old row protocol carries no matched
cell launch, so that path cannot assert "this ran native" -- it
refuses every substitute the pin names and stamps the served decoder set it
observed, which is the positive claim the receipt carries.  Coverage
strictness is uncalibrated against a real serve (nothing has been served
yet on this side): both directions refuse, and relaxing either needs a
measured serve, not an argument.
