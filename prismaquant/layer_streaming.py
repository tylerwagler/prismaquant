"""Shared primitives for layer-by-layer streaming of HF model weights
from safetensors.

Used by the unified incremental probe, cost, and export paths. Each
primitive is a pure move from the original monolithic streaming probe —
signatures and behavior are byte-identical. The goal is to share one
install/unload/cache implementation across every stage of the pipeline
so the allocator's view of layer materialization is the same regardless
of which script is driving it.

Notes:
  - The `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` hack must be
    set by the *entrypoint* module before torch.cuda initializes; it is
    deliberately NOT set here so this module can be imported lazily
    after cuda is already up.

    layers consume `input_ids` for the `tid2eid` lookup). Layers that

    Most models use one full causal mask. Hybrid models declare
    ``config.layer_types`` mixing ``full_attention`` with one of:

    - ``sliding_attention`` (Gemma3/Gemma4-style windowed attention) — needs
      the dense additive mask from HuggingFace's own ``masking_utils``
      (``create_sliding_window_causal_mask``), same family as
      ``full_attention``'s ``create_causal_mask``, just windowed.
    - ``linear_attention`` (Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 DeltaNet-style recurrent
      hybrids) — NOT a variant of causal attention at all. The recurrence
      is already causal by construction; what the layer needs is the
      recurrent-mask contract of current HuggingFace
      ``masking_utils.create_recurrent_attention_mask`` (>= 5.15): a 2D
      ``[batch, local_seq]`` padding mask trimmed to the current forward's
      sequence, or ``None`` whenever masking would be a no-op (non-2D
      input, single-token decode, all-ones batch). We always apply the
      local ``_recurrent_padding_mask`` shim implementing that contract —
      see its docstring for why the upstream helper is not called even
      when present (5.13/5.14 ship it with the broken pre-fix contract).
      Feeding these layers the dense ``[1, 1, T, T]`` causal mask instead
      — the bug this branch fixes — broadcasts wrongly against
      ``hidden_states`` inside ``apply_mask_to_padding_states`` and, on
      transformers >= 5.15 (which removed the padding-mask shape guard),
      raises a tensor-size mismatch on the last dim (hidden_size vs.
      seqlen); an un-trimmed growing cache-continuation mask can mismatch
      the same way, which is why the raw incoming mask is not passed
      through either.

    Both hybrid kinds return the same ``{layer_type: mask}`` mapping shape;
    ``_call_layer`` selects the right entry per layer via its
    ``layer.layer_type``.
