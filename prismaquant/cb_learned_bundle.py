"""Immutable, value-bearing learned-codebook bundles for the CB producer.

The cost, cache, KL, allocator, and export stages must render against the same
codebook *values*.  A digest-only manifest is deliberately insufficient: it can
identify values but cannot supply them to the encoder.  This module therefore
stores canonical FP16 tables and their strict manifest together in one
safetensors ``.pqcb`` file.

The training primitive is the FABLE-certified pooled weighted-Lloyd algorithm
formerly owned only by :mod:`tools.dsv4_cbl_kernels`.  It stays independent of
model loading and cache residency here: a production driver supplies already
decoded weights and the exact imatrix tensors, using the repository's existing
streaming/prefetch path.

    The default ``trainer_version="v1"`` preserves the historical policy and
    artifact identity.  Version 2 defaults every K4..K48 step-4 rung to
    lattice and promotes a rung only when a complete two-holdout
    ``promotion_receipt`` says learned.  With v2, an explicit
    ``learned_formats`` must exactly match the receipt-derived sources; it
    cannot override them.  The formats may be common to all qnames or supplied
    per qname.  For large
    models, pass ``qnames`` plus ``weight_provider`` instead of ``weights``:
    each decoded weight is requested once, all of its rung cells are trained,
    and it is released before the next qname.  This keeps residency to one
    source tensor plus the tiny accumulated FP16 books.

    ``pretrained_codebooks`` supplies immutable, value-bearing cells keyed by
    ``(qname, canonical_format)``.  The provider spelling is invoked only
    after that qname's current weight and imatrix tensors are resident, so a
    bank loader can verify their exact identities before returning bytes.  A
    supplied cell (static or provider-backed) is the only production route for
    a rank-3 routed-expert population: expert books measured during a burn must
    be copied byte-for-byte into the bundle, never retrained at export time.

    ``routed_book_keying`` records which rule burned each routed learned book —
    ``"stack"`` (one book per ``(layer, stack, rung)``, gate and up pooled) or
    ``"role"`` (one book per ``(layer, projection, rung)``).  A book's
    calibration is its identity, and so is the population it was pooled over,
    so the keying is written onto every routed learned cell.  Pass one value
    for the whole build or a per-qname mapping; omit it and each cell's name
    decides.
