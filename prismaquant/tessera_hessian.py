"""One Hessian, one identity, two callers.

The Tessera encoder's shipping default is *activation-aware*: given a unit's
``H = XᵀX`` it applies LDLQ (sigma 1.0, block 32) plus an exact full-Hessian
row-scale refit, and served KL on Qwen3-0.6B went 0.1512 -> 0.1046 at
byte-identical wire bpp.  Weights-only encodes stay byte-identical, so an H is
not a tuning knob: a rung priced without one is a price of *different bytes at
the same format name*.

Two PrismaQuant paths hand Tessera a Hessian -- the anchor campaign
(``tessera_campaign``) and the production render
(``tessera_render.render_tessera_production``, reached from
``ProductionWeightCache``).  Principle 8 says the surrogate, the KL validation
and the shipped bytes must be one rendering; if those two paths form H
differently, or from different calibration draws, they are two renderings with
one name and nothing raises.  So both call the functions here:

* :func:`hessian_from_rows` -- the only place ``XᵀX`` is formed, in one dtype
  and one accumulation order.
* :func:`calibration_identity` -- the only place the draw is named, and it
  emits exactly the triple Tessera's ``ActivationSource`` requires
  (``text_sha256``, ``fit_tokens``, ``fit_ids_sha256``).  Tessera refuses a
  provenance missing any of them, and the refusal is the point: an identity of
  ``None`` compares equal to another ``None``, which is how a merge guard goes
  vacuous.
* :func:`encoder_kwargs` -- the only place an ``ActivationSource`` is turned
  into encoder keywords, so the recipe (sigma, block, refit objective) is read
  from Tessera's own defaults rather than restated on either side.

The LDL factorisation is the expensive part and it is **rung-independent**: one
unit's H yields one ``ldl`` that every rate on that unit reuses, so callers
that sweep rungs compute the kwargs once rather than paying for twelve
identical block-LDLs across a twelve-anchor surface.

It is **not plane-independent**.  Tessera keys the refit objective by scale
plane -- the exact quadratic on a CHANNEL row scale, a diagonal power on the
LUT plane's coupled blocks -- because the two answers were measured separately
and disagree, and ``for_unit`` refuses a caller that does not name the plane
rather than serving it one of them.  The plane is a property of the grid and
not of the rung (constant across every rung of every family PrismaQuant
allocates; ``channel`` on E4M3, ``lut16`` on E2M1 and the free grids), so the
memo key is ``(unit, plane)`` and the bound is one factorisation per unit per
family-plane.  The plane must come from the recipe the encode itself resolved,
threaded as an object: a second lookup agrees only while nothing clears
``tessera_formats._recipe_for``, and pricing a unit under the other plane's
objective prices an artifact the export does not ship (principle 8).

    an artifact the export does not ship (principle 8).

    factorisation) and ``ldl_block`` depend on the Hessian and the source's

    and sweep settings are resolved for the unit's plane. The plane is a

    families --
    ``channel`` on ``TESSERA_E4M3_K1``, ``lut16`` on both E2M1 families and

    the signature has nowhere to put one -- but it is keyed by ``(unit,
    plane)``, not by unit.  The bound is one factorisation per unit per
    distinct plane actually encoded, which on a single-family surface is one.

    A missing key or a wrong width raises inside Tessera, by design: both
    would otherwise be silent, and a wrong key encodes the unit weights-only,
