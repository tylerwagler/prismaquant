"""measure_quant_cost.py — per-(Linear, format) RTN quantization error.

Two execution modes:

  1. BATCHED GPU (default when --device cuda): groups Linears by
     (in_features, out_features) signature, stacks each group into a
     single 3D tensor, and runs ONE torch.bmm per (group, format).
     For a 35B MoE model this reduces ~31 000 tiny kernel launches
     down to ~360, which is the difference between 42-hour GPU runtime
     and ~1-3 minute runtime on unified-memory systems.

  2. UNBATCHED CPU (default when --device cpu): streams weights one at
     a time via the live model, processes sequentially. Simpler, slower
     per-item but avoids any memory-packing cost — fine for systems
     where the GPU path is slower than CPU (e.g. GB10 when operating
     on many sub-millisecond matmuls through unified memory).

Output format is identical between modes: a dict keyed by Linear name,
each entry mapping format name to {weight_mse, output_mse,
rel_output_mse}. When h-detail is supplied, entries may also include
`predicted_dloss` and `fisher_output_mse`.
