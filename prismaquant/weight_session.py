"""Incremental weight materialization session for polish.

Polish does many KL measurements; each measurement differs from the
previous by a single unit's format.  The naive path re-materializes
every Linear from BF16 source per measurement, which on a 27B model
with 305 units doubles GPU memory (model + clones of every materialized
slot) and OOMs on a 121 GB UMA.

WeightSession instead:

- Materializes the baseline assignment ONCE on the live model.params.
- Tracks the BF16 source for each unit (lazy-populated on first
  quantization) so any unit can be reverted later without keeping a
  full model backup.
- Exposes ``stage_format(qname, new_fmt)`` to swap a single unit and
  ``revert_last()`` / ``commit_last()`` to undo or accept the swap.
- Per trial, the only new allocation is one unit's worth of weight
  data (~50–500 MB).  No per-trial 54 GB clone.

Memory: 1× model (live) + bf16_originals (~half a model after every
unit has been quantized once) + working set.  On 27B that's ~70 GB
total + working ~10 GB, comfortably under a 121 GB UMA.
