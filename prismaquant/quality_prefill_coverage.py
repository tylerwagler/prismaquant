"""When a proposal may call itself the whole-model frontier, and when it may not.

Specification section 5.2 of ``docs/design/tessera_quality_prefill_experiment.md``.

Section 5.2 states one equality and one consequence. The equality is between
four memberships that are produced by four different stages and drift apart
quietly:

* the full mutable serving-unit census,
* the quality table's coverage,
* the runtime binding's expansion, and
* the selected assignment's membership.

The consequence is that a proposal may be labelled
``whole_model_retained_menu_frontier`` only when all four are the *same set*
and every routed stack is complete down to its members. Anything less keeps
its ``restricted_pilot`` label. A pilot operator frontier is still a real
result; it is just a result about the units it actually covered.

:func:`frontier_label` therefore never returns a verdict without also
returning why, and :func:`require_census_equality` refuses by naming the exact
symmetric difference rather than a count. "17 units differ" sends you looking;
"layers.3.mlp.shared.down is in the census and not in the runtime binding"
tells you what happened.

A routed stack needs every required member's wire, scale, source/PWC and
aligned joint row. The high/low routing-count expert diagnostic of section 5.1
is two members out of hundreds, so :func:`routed_stack_gaps` treats a
diagnostic draw as a gap, not as coverage -- which is the whole reason the
function exists.
