"""The production menu over Tessera's continuous rate axis.

``tessera_formats`` says which rungs *exist* (thousands of them across four
families, at a 1/256-bpp quantum) and ``tessera_render`` says how to price one.
This module is the third thing the production allocator needs: **which of them
may enter a menu for THIS unit, on THIS target**, and it is the only place that
answers it.

Three gates, and they are deliberately separate
-----------------------------------------------
1. **The wire can carry it.**  ``tessera_rung_is_serialisable`` -- the grid's
   digest is a permanent commitment in Tessera's ``SERIALISABLE_GRIDS``.  A rung
   that fails this dies in ``alphabet_plane()`` at export, after the allocation
   and the whole production cache have been built, so the menu asks up front.
2. **The shape can carry it.**  Tessera's own raise sites, asked by
   construction rather than by catching: arity divides the rows, the
   super-symbol span divides the trellis positions, the rung's Bresenham root
   is realisable over the column count, and the block scale plane's period
   divides the tensor.  Plus the **serving TP degree**, which shards the shape
   before the runtime ever sees it (:func:`tessera_shard_granularity`).
3. **A pinned runtime executes it.**  :func:`route_admission` -- ONE lookup,
   against the pinned serving release's own published contract (principle 14).

Gate 3 reads the current pinned runtime and serving scope
--------------------------------------------------------
The table that answers is **Tessera's own** packaged
``tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json``. Its native cells declare the
families, rates and serving contexts that are qualified. Since 2026-09-04,
``tessera_serving_runtime_pin`` names an exact Tessera commit and the SHA-256
of the contract it packages. Matching cells can be admitted when the installed
contract matches that digest and the requested scope; an absent cell or a
different contract remains unattested. Reader support for a wider rate range
does not qualify every rate for serving. Moving the pin edits the JSON and
module constants together, including when a new producer API requires a newer
commit with unchanged contract bytes.

Which is why the ``detail`` on an unattested rung names the conjunct that
actually refused (``tessera_render.tessera_lane_admission`` returns it beside
the verdict).  "Unattested" alone is four different facts, and reporting the
wrong one sends a reader to re-pin a contract that already has the row.

So the menu carries a **mode**, and the default is the attested one::

    MENU_ATTESTED  (default)   only rungs a pinned runtime attests
    MENU_READABLE  (opt-in)    only rungs the pinned contract's own decoder
                               accepts -- its family is published and the rate
                               falls inside ``reader_rate_range_q256`` -- each
                               still stamped ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED
    MENU_RESEARCH  (opt-in)    every writable, shape-legal rung, each stamped
                               ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED

``MENU_READABLE`` sits between the two and is a *decoder* fact, not a receipt.
A campaign under ``MENU_RESEARCH`` prices rungs no reader will ever accept --
on the #275 LFM campaign, 168 rows at 27 s each on ``TESSERA_E2M1_K1``, a
family the pinned contract does not publish at all, plus two of three
``TESSERA_E2M1_K2`` anchors outside its ``[896, 896]`` reader range.  Those
bytes cannot be served by anything, so measuring them buys nothing.  What
``readable`` does NOT do is change any status: a readable-but-unattested rung
carries :data:`ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED` on every stamp, and the export gate
fails closed on it exactly as it does under research mode.  It is a PRICING
menu, and P9's route gate stays on ``route_status`` -- "the decoder reads
these bytes" is not "the runtime serves them natively".

Like the attestation, it is derived from whichever table answers: the
``reader_rate_range`` of the dev-pin contract when ``PRISMAQUANT_TESSERA_DEV_
PIN`` is set, and the packaged ``formats`` row's ``reader_rate_range_q256``
otherwise.  Both publish the field, so ``readable`` is a usable menu with or
without the pin -- unlike ``attested``, which needs the pin to admit anything.

``MENU_RESEARCH`` is not an override of the gate; it is the gate reporting
itself.  Principle 1 is explicit that route status "never removes an honestly
priced rung from the menu -- an allocator that wants an unservable rung is
reporting a serving gap"; principle 9 puts the refusal at **export**, per
artifact, on ``route_status``.  So a research-mode allocation is a measurement
that names its own unservability on every unit and in its provenance, and the
export gate refuses it for the same reason it would refuse any unattested unit.
Nothing here can make an unattested rung exportable.

The rate axis is priced by campaign, not by enumeration
-------------------------------------------------------
Four families address thousands of rungs at every shape -- 6764 on a
2048x1024 unit, 3709 of them the 16-bit family's.  Rendering all of them is
not a cost model, it is a week.  :mod:`prismaquant.tessera_campaign` renders a small
measured **anchor** set per (unit, family) and interpolates the rest through
``tessera_rate_surface``, with leave-one-anchor-out and allocation-regret gates
deciding how many anchors that is.  This module supplies the *legal* set the
campaign samples from and the dense menu it fills in.

    """The pinned runtime's verdict on one Tessera rung.  **The one seam.**

    This is the single function in the production path that reads a serving
    contract on Tessera's behalf.  Everything else -- the menu, the campaign,
    the candidate gate, the provenance -- consumes :class:`RouteAdmission`, so
    when the Tessera serving lane publishes its own ``runtime_contract.json``
    the swap is this function's body and nothing else.

    **Deliberately not memoised**, and the reason is worth keeping. A cache
    over a runtime-contract read outlives the contract, and here that is not
    hypothetical: an ``lru_cache`` keyed on the rung name silently inverted
    ``test_no_tessera_rung_is_producer_eligible_on_the_pinned_release``, which
    runs after a test that patches the attestation to True and duly read back
    "eligible" for a rung nothing serves. Putting the resolved callables in the
    key fixes that case and not the next one -- a test that patches
    ``_pinned_serving_table`` instead changes the contract without changing any
    function object, and the stale verdict comes straight back (it did). The
    key this cache would need is the identity of the contract itself, which it
    cannot state, so it does not get a cache. It does not need one: the whole
    lookup is ~0.1 ms (parse 0.002, attest 0.016, serialisable 0.072, recipe +
    route 0.006 ms) *because the serialisable leg asks the family's grid rather
    than the rung* -- ask it per rung and one 16-bit menu spends 34 ms a rung
    re-hashing 65536 values -- the expensive part of a menu is the per-rung
    Bresenham
    realisability check.  That check *is* memoised per ``(family, rung, shape)``
    -- ``_shard_geometry`` and ``tessera_footprint._exact_bits_for_shape``,
    both sized by :func:`menu_cache_bound` -- but ``expand_tessera_menu``
    itself is not, and never was: it returns a fresh list its callers are free
    to keep.

    Today it delegates to ``tessera_render.tessera_lane_admission``, which
    resolves the rung against **Tessera's own** packaged
    ``runtime_contract.json`` through the shared ``lane_eligibility`` parser.
    That table publishes the attested Tessera families and their receipted
    rungs, so what refuses is the third conjunct whenever the installed
    Tessera is not the pinned commit/digest, and the fourth whenever the
    cell's own packaged evidence records a degenerate smoke.  The answer is
    then :data:`ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED`.  The ``detail`` says which conjunct, verbatim from the
    admission, because a rung refused by the pin and a rung refused by an
    absent cell need different fixes and must not read the same.

    Before any of that, it runs :func:`check_tessera_activation_agreement`
    whenever cells attest the rung: the priced ``route`` and the executed
    cell ``activation_contract`` must project to the same ``(act_bits,
    act_group_size)``, on both the dev-pin and the packaged-contract paths.

    A v5 development contract requires the caller's complete serving context.
    Its own scoped lookup checks every required regime under that one target;
    an absent context cannot borrow the runtime or structure of another cell.
    A legacy contract retains its context-free admission but cannot attest a
    newly supplied runtime context it has no per-cell evidence to answer.

    Beside the attestation it also derives :attr:`RouteAdmission.readable` --
    does the pinned contract's own decoder accept this rate at all -- from the
    same one read, on both paths: ``reader_rate_range`` on the dev-pin
    contract and ``reader_rate_range_q256`` on the packaged ``formats`` row.
    It is deliberately independent of the serving scope, of the release pin
    and of the cell census, because none of those is what makes a reader
    accept bytes; and it is deliberately NOT allowed to move ``route_status``,
    which stays :data:`ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED` until a cell attests the rung.

    A tensor-parallel rank is handed a *slice* of the Linear, and a Tessera unit
    is not slice-agnostic: the trellis runs down a column across ``arity``-row
    tuples grouped into ``span``-wide super-symbols, the block scale plane tiles
    the input axis in fixed periods, and a mixed Bresenham schedule only closes
    its quota on a whole superblock.  A slice that cuts any of those periods
    produces bytes no reader can decode alone.

    **The number is Tessera's, not ours.**  ``tessera.layout.shard_granularity``
    derives both periods from the checks ``slice_unit`` itself applies; this
    function builds the unit-shaped geometry that rung implies at that shape
    (:class:`_ShardGeometry`) and asks.  Until 2026-09-02 Tessera published no
    such function and this module derived the periods itself, which was a
    restatement waiting to drift -- and it did: the fallback answered
    ``col_granularity == 1`` for every CHANNEL-plane rung, while Tessera's
    answer is the 256-column superblock for any rung whose Bresenham schedule
    is *mixed*, i.e. for all but the handful of integer-rate rungs. That is the
    single most consequential TP fact on this menu, and no amount of care in a
    local derivation would have produced it.

    ``shape`` is the **whole** unit's ``[rows, cols]``: a granularity is a
    property of the unit being cut, and the rate schedule that decides
    ``mixed`` is a function of its column count. The sharded extents are then

    say it serves this family at this world size at all
    (:func:`tessera_tp_world_attested`)?  That is a *different* question from

    names which one answered.  The research menu passes ``False``: it prices
    unattested rungs deliberately and stamps every one of them, so a second
    attestation refusal there would only hide the pricing.

    Then two questions, both asked of Tessera:

    * **Can the whole unit be cut this way at all?**
      ``tessera.layout.can_shard(unit, tp, axis)`` -- and the axis mapping is
      Tessera's, not a local convention: a *column-parallel* Linear (q/k/v,
      gate/up) splits vLLM's output features, which are this unit's **rows**,
      so ``PARALLEL_COLUMN`` asks ``axis="row"``.  Inverting that pair would
      gate exactly the wrong half of a model and answer plausibly on both.
    * **Is the rung legal on the shard a rank actually holds?**
      ``tessera_shape_legal`` on the sharded shape: at TP=8 a ``[2048, 1024]``
      column-parallel Linear is eight ``[256, 1024]`` units, each encoded and
      decoded on its own rank, and a rung legal on the whole is not
      automatically legal on an eighth of it (its Bresenham root has to close
      its quota over the shard's own column count).

    ``parallel_kind`` is the unit's, from the caller's serving profile;
    ``PARALLEL_NONE`` (a packed expert under expert parallelism, a replicated

    indistinguishable *to the solver*, so keeping the lower-cost one changes no
    answer it could have given -- which is a different and weaker statement than
    :func:`prune_dominated`'s, and is why the two are separate functions with
    separately reported counts.

    The distinction matters for reading a receipt.  If an allocation's selected
    rates look coarse, this tells you whether the campaign priced few rungs
    (a campaign result) or the DP's bin width swallowed them (a
    ``--bit-precision`` result).  On a 0.6B model a 3M-parameter Linear holds a
    fraction near 0.007 of the body, so Tessera's 1/256-bpp step is ~2.7e-5
    average bits and the default ``bit_precision=1e-4`` resolves roughly one
    rung in four.  Neither number is a constant here: both are reported.

    ``FORMATS=NVFP4,FP8_DYNAMIC,TESSERA`` is how a launcher asks for "the
    stock two, plus Tessera". The token cannot expand to a static list: a
    family's realisable rungs depend on the unit's column count, and a single
    0.6B Linear carries thousands of them across the four families, so the menu
    is a per-unit object and not a comma-separated string. What it expands to
    instead is the set of Tessera columns the run's own cost table holds --
    every rung an anchor campaign priced, and nothing else.

    That is the honest expansion in both directions. Wider is impossible: a
    rung with no cost row is dropped by ``build_candidates`` regardless.
    Narrower would be a heuristic choosing the DP's candidate set, which
    principle 1 vetoes.

    One filter survives that veto, and it is principle 9's, not an exception:
    **the token expands only to rungs the pinned runtime attests**. A cost
    table is priced under whatever menu mode the campaign ran (``research``
    prices the whole realisable axis on purpose), and the attested set is a
    property of the *runtime*, not of the campaign. So a research-priced table
    read back on the default path holds thousands of columns the pinned
    contract does not publish. Expanding to them would only have
    ``require_producer_formats`` refuse the entire run -- the whole menu, not
    the unbacked part of it -- and the DP would never see the rungs that ARE
    backed. The filter is the same predicate that guard refuses on, so the
    token cannot expand to something the guard then rejects: one rule, two
    uses, no second copy of the legality decision. An explicitly named
    reader-only rung still refuses, exactly as before; only the token narrows,
    and it reports what it narrowed so the run says out loud which axis it is
    allocating over.

    Order is preserved and duplicates removed, so a menu with no token is

    """Every Tessera row in one cost table must share one Hessian identity.

    The encoder's shipping default consumes a per-unit ``XᵀX``; a row priced
    without one describes different bytes than a row priced with one, at the
    same format name and the same bpp. A table holding both is not a menu with
    a caveat, it is two menus wearing one label, and the DP will happily trade
    a row of the first against a row of the second.

    This is the merge guard the encoder-drift incident argued for, applied to
    the cost table instead of the encoder: two halves built by different code
    were invisible precisely because nothing compared them. Returns the single
    identity (as a dict) for stamping, or raises.

    Rows written before this field existed carry no ``hessian_identity``; they
    are counted and reported as ``unstamped`` rather than assumed to match,
    because "no claim" and "a matching claim" are different facts (P14).

    The identity includes ``text_sha`` even when ``supplied`` is false, so two
    weights-only campaigns on different calibration draws are refused as mixed
    although their *bytes* are identical. That is deliberate and not a bug: the
    bytes are draw-independent but the **scores** attached to them are not --
    ``output_mse`` is measured against that draw's activations -- and it is the
    scores the DP trades.

    The per-row ``applied`` flag is deliberately **not** part of the key. At the
    pinned Tessera an activation-aware encode needs a CHANNEL scale plane, so an
    E4M3 row is H-aware and an E2M1 row cannot be, in the same table, from one
    campaign, on one draw. Those rows *are* comparable -- each is the price of
    its own rung's shipping bytes -- and refusing the table would refuse the
    mixed-family menu this whole stage exists to build. What must match is the
    DRAW and the run's intent, which is what the key holds.

    **The key is the whole identity, the required triple first.**  Tessera's
    own required roster -- ``text_sha256`` / ``fit_tokens`` / ``fit_ids_sha256``,
    read from ``tessera_hessian.HESSIAN_IDENTITY_FIELDS`` rather than retyped
    -- is what names *which* Hessian shaped the bytes, and until 2026-09-05
    this guard compared only the legacy ``(supplied, text_sha, token_count,
    kwarg)`` projection, so any number of distinct modern identities collapsed
    to one key and a table merged from two draws allocated as one
    (RobTand/prismaquant#195).  Three row classes now exist and are refused
    from merging with each other:

    * **modern** -- carries the full required triple; keyed on the triple AND
      the legacy aliases, so aliases that agree cannot launder a triple that
      does not.
    * **legacy** -- carries none of the triple (written before it existed);
      keyed on the legacy fields alone, and never merged with a modern row:
      "no claim about the triple" and "a matching triple" are different facts
      (P14).
    * **partial** -- carries some of the triple; that is a malformed identity
      and is refused by name rather than downgraded to the legacy comparison.

    The returned dict carries the canonical triple beside the legacy
    projection, so the allocator's ``tessera_hessian`` metadata block -- which
    stamps this return verbatim into ``layer_config.json`` -- gives export a
    Hessian identity it can bind a capture against.

    **The capture's content digest is part of the key too**
    (RobTand/prismaquant#204).  The triple names the token draw and not the
    Hessian: two captures of one draw with different ``H`` -- a different
    sequence layout, a re-capture, a rewritten payload -- carry one triple
    and encode different bytes at the same format name.  The campaign stamps
    every row with ``capture_sha256``, the digest of exactly the payload it
    wrote for the export leg, and rows carrying two digests under one triple
    are two captures, refused from merging.  ``None`` (a weights-only
    campaign, or a table written before the digest existed) is its own
    value, never wildcarded against a digest: the returned ``capture_sha256``
    is what the export gate binds the payload to, and a table without one
    yields an allocation the gate refuses as unbound.

# a **byte-matched uniform** arm.  The allocation lost at every budget: served
# KL-vs-BF16 0.3485 against 0.1746 at 4.0 bpp, 2.33x at 3.0, 2.88x at 5.0, with
# bytes exact to the bit and 112/112 modules on the declared route.
#
# The loss is in the cost model, on the units the cost model priced: a separator
# pair serving only the seven measured Linears reads 0.02517 allocated against
# 0.01306 uniform (1.93x), which is 95% of the whole-body gap in log terms, and
# the same seven units score 1.13x *better* in the allocator's own currency.
#
# It is a **slope** error, not an ordering error, and that is why nothing in
# this module caught it.  ``TesseraRateSurface`` refuses a non-monotone anchor
# set rather than laundering it into a cost, so the ORDINAL assumption is
# guarded -- but the measured failure never violates it: the surrogate got the
# sign of the expensive move right (it charged ``down_proj`` at R749 3.69x, its
# largest penalty) and mispriced the *gain* from bits above R1006, scoring the
# other six moves as a 1.30x net win where serving says 1.19x loss.  Every
# construction downstream of the cost -- surface interpolation, dominance
# pruning, bin collapse, the group Minkowski fold, the DP itself -- is exact
