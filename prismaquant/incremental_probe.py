"""incremental_probe.py — PrismaQuant sensitivity probe, streamed shard-by-shard.

This is the unified probe path. There is no separate "whole model fits in
RAM" branch: the model is always loaded via the layer-streaming primitives
in `layer_streaming`, with the head (embed + norm + lm_head + rotary)
resident and decoder layers offloaded to disk and streamed in on demand.
Small models just pay the no-op cost of a LayerCache that can hold every
layer resident; large models drain the cache to disk as needed.

Each shard (body layer range, MTP, lm_head) runs one streaming pass: the
exact phase-1 / phase-2 / phase-3 flow from `streaming_probe.run_streaming_probe`,
specialized to Fisher-instrument only the Linears matching that shard's
regex. MTP is a built-in shard kind: after the body forward we ask the
model profile to build its MTP module (`profile.build_mtp_module`), load
the source MTP weights straight from safetensors
(`profile.read_mtp_source_state_dict` / `profile.load_mtp_state_dict`),
and run its own forward+backward for Fisher collection. The per-shard pickle
output format matches `sensitivity_probe.run_probe_pass` / `streaming_probe`
unchanged — the allocator consumes either. The two backends also agree on
the estimator and normalization conventions: per-token-summed empirical
Fisher (Σ_t ‖∇_t‖², including packed experts via the F.linear
interception in `install_packed_expert_hooks`), divided by the GLOBAL
calibration token count for every row -- dense and MoE expert alike.
(This paragraph used to say "the tokens each entry actually saw (routed
tokens for MoE experts)". That was audit M4's convention and PR #14
reversed it: a per-routed-token denominator inflates a rarely-routed
expert by global/routed, which is inverted importance weighting for the
mean-Δloss objective. `finalize_fisher_stats` carries the derivation.)

The one quantity that is still per-routed-token is the AQUA A-side's
activation VARIANCE fit, and deliberately so: `expert_act_sq_sum` is
divided by `expert_tokens[e]` because it models the per-token noise
magnitude of the rows that flow through expert e, not that expert's
share of the objective. See `_accumulate_packed_per_token_fisher`.

#
# plus the two pure factors (g_sq_sum, act_sq_sum) that let a consumer
# separate "this output channel has hot gradients" from "this input
# channel has hot activations", and act_absmax for clipping decisions.
#
# The row/col marginals are read off the `chunk_h` every accumulation
# site already materializes, so they cost no extra matmul AND satisfy

# HF MiniMax-M2 represents the 256 experts as a ModuleList and its
# `MiniMaxM2Experts.forward` loops over every hit expert in Python:
#   torch.where(...) -> expert MLP -> index_add_
# With 4 x 256 tokens and top-k=8, almost every expert is hit, so one
# layer replay issues ~256 tiny expert MLPs. The GPU stays mostly idle
# while CPU burns time launching thousands of small ops.
#
# During Phase-3 only the shard's target layers need nn.Linear hooks.
# Non-target layers merely propagate grad_out backward to earlier
# activations, so we can replace the ModuleList loop with chunked batched
# expert matmuls for those layers. Target layers keep the original module
# path so per-expert Linear hooks still fire exactly as before.
