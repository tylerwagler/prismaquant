"""The PrismaQuant Sensitivity Card: a shareable, format-independent probe artifact.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Probing a model is the expensive, model-specific half of PrismaQuant. Choosing
formats is the cheap, *platform*-specific half. Today those two halves are fused:
``probe.pkl`` carries scalars that are only meaningful next to a rendered cost
cache built for one particular format menu, so a new menu means a new probe.

A Sensitivity Card breaks that coupling. It is measured **once** per
(model, calibration) and carries enough structure that an *arbitrary* format
menu can be priced locally, without touching the model again. The author of a
downstream artifact supplies their own format list and platform profile; the
card supplies the sensitivity.

WHAT MAKES AN ARBITRARY MENU PRICEABLE
--------------------------------------
The probe already computes, per Linear, the per-element diagonal empirical
Fisher of the weight matrix::

    H[o, i] = sum_t  g[t, o]^2 * x[t, i]^2

(`incremental_probe.py`: ``chunk_h = gy2_sq.t() @ x2_sq``). Storing ``H`` is
what makes a full-detail probe unshippable -- the unified-sweep path documents
it as "47k x 17 MB = 800 GB CPU, doesn't fit" and therefore keeps only the two
scalars ``h_trace`` and ``h_w2_sum``.

But every quantity a format-agnostic cost needs is a **marginal** of ``H``, and
each marginal is a pair of reductions that never forms the [out, in] matrix:

    fisher_row[o] = sum_i H[o, i] = sum_t g[t,o]^2 * (sum_i x[t,i]^2)
    fisher_col[i] = sum_o H[o, i] = sum_t (sum_o g[t,o]^2) * x[t,i]^2

Cost: ``out + in`` floats per Linear instead of ``out * in``. For a 27B dense
model that is tens of MB rather than hundreds of GB, and it is available even on
the memory-bounded unified sweep that cannot accumulate ``h_full`` at all.

Two further vectors are stored because they are *not* recoverable from the
weight-Fisher marginals and are what activation-quantization awareness
(AQUA-AURA) is built on:

    act_sq_sum[i] = sum_t x[t, i]^2      # the imatrix / diag(X^T X)
    g_sq_sum[o]   = sum_t g[t, o]^2      # the OUTPUT-space Fisher diagonal

``act_sq_sum`` lets any downstream format weight its weight error by the
activation distribution the layer actually sees. ``g_sq_sum`` is the term that
converts an *output* perturbation into a loss delta, which is precisely what an
input-side (activation-quantization) error needs and what ``h_trace`` -- a
weight-space quantity -- cannot supply.

Consistency is checkable for free: ``sum(fisher_row) == sum(fisher_col) ==
h_trace_raw`` up to float error. :func:`SensitivityUnit.validate` enforces it.

CURRENCY IS EXPLICIT AND FAIL-CLOSED
------------------------------------
``activation_fair_pricing.py`` is a 120-line autopsy of what happens when one
family is priced on two bases. Every cost component in this module therefore
declares its :class:`Currency`, and mixing them raises rather than silently
producing a number. See also the CB-lane finding that a factorization law which
holds in activation currency *fails* in weight_mse currency across a basis
change.

CALIBRATION IS IDENTITY
-----------------------
A card measured on one calibration is not interchangeable with another, exactly
as a CB codebook's imatrix is hashed into its book key. ``calib_hash`` is part
of the card's identity; :func:`SensitivityCard.assert_compatible` refuses
cross-calibration merges and comparisons.

STRUCTURE vs POLICY
-------------------
The card carries model **structure** (which Linears are siblings, their shapes,
their source dtype) because that is a property of the checkpoint and is true for
every consumer. It deliberately does **not** carry serving **policy** (that
fused siblings must share one format, that packed experts must use vLLM
canonical scheme names) because that is a property of the downstream runtime and
belongs to the profile the author names. Baking vLLM's packing rules into a
shareable file would make the file wrong for llama.cpp, and wrong the day vLLM
changes.
