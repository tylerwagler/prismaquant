"""Read the Tessera serving plugin's own packaged runtime contract.

Principle 14 in one file: every statement PrismaQuant makes about what a
Tessera artifact *serves* -- which family, at which rate, on which route,
behind which serve flags, at which tensor-parallel world size -- is read from
``tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json``, the table the plugin packages and
publishes, or it is refused.  Nothing here decides anything; it parses.

Since Tessera contract v7 that table also publishes what the plugin *LOADS*
(``native_extensions``: which CUDA library, under which filename pattern,
matched by which named rule, and what runs instead when it is absent), which
is the other §7.4 fact PrismaQuant used to maintain on this side by hand.
:func:`require_pin_native_extensions_match_contract` is the refusal that keeps
the serving pin a transcription of it.

The cell grammar has one home in ``lane_eligibility``. This reader adds the
development answer pin, format ranges, native-extension identity and fused
module licence; export uses the same parsed cells under the separate serving
pin. Since lane schema v4, residency scopes each cell and ``executes`` names
its launches. Both readers retain those fields and reject malformed or
overlapping claims through the shared parser. Neither accepts a Gridbook
schema; that serving lane was retired on 2026-09-02.

**The dev pin.** This reader provides an explicit development answer pin.
Serving and export separately require the exact commit and packaged contract
digest in ``tessera_serving_runtime_pin``; that gate does not require a release
tag. The development override is explicit:

* ``PRISMAQUANT_TESSERA_DEV_PIN=<anything non-empty>`` opts in.  The value is
  recorded verbatim in provenance as what the operator asked for; it is not
  the gate.
* the installed contract's **answer** -- every value the ADMISSION gate
  reads, in the vocabulary of :func:`contract_answer` -- must equal
  :data:`TESSERA_DEV_PIN_ANSWER` or the read raises, with a field-level diff
  naming what moved.
* unset disables this development reader: it returns ``None`` without reading
  a contract. This does not replace the separate serving/export pin checks.

There is no third state.  A mismatch never degrades to "unattested" -- that
would turn a stale pin into a silently empty menu, which is the failure mode
this whole file exists to prevent.

**Why the answer and not the bytes** (issue #38).  This pin used to compare
the environment's value against an exact commit and the file's sha256 against
a recorded one.  Both legs fired on *identity*, and the thing they name is an
editable checkout on the same box, so every Tessera commit that touched the
contract -- a prose ``detail``, a changelog paragraph, a ``contract_version``
bump -- turned PrismaQuant's attested path off and a fistful of tests red in a
repo nobody was editing, while the two rungs' meaning had not moved at all.
That is principle 14 read backwards: prose fields explain, they are never a
value a gate reads, so a prose edit is not a thing to re-review.  The gate now
reads the answer.  A commit that moves no answer passes silently; a commit
that moves one refuses and says which field, which is a review prompt rather
than a corruption warning.  :data:`TESSERA_DEV_PIN_COMMIT` and
:data:`TESSERA_DEV_PIN_CONTRACT_SHA256` survive as the *record of the review*
-- the build and the bytes a human read when the answer was accepted -- and
travel into provenance alongside the bytes this run actually read, so
prose-only drift is visible without being fatal.

This is deliberately weaker than an exact contract-byte pin: it admits any
Tessera whose table answers identically, which is exactly the claim
this development reader makes about it. The serving pin independently requires
the reviewed contract bytes, whether or not the pinned version is a release.

The contract's own identity (commit, sha, path, schema, contract_version)
travels into every allocation's provenance as ``tessera_dev_pin`` so a
shipcard records which table admitted its units.

#: The Tessera commit this pin's answer was reviewed against.  Declared and

#: event -- :data:`TESSERA_DEV_PIN_ANSWER` is what refuses. Re-pinned
#: 2026-09-09 to b1eb1dccc (Tessera #437/#438) for the opt-in best-form
#: window encoder and explicit tile controls. Actual GLM endpoint runs retain
#: exact wire bytes and scores; no encoder default or serving cell changes.
#: The pin also includes the reviewed cached-export and rank-local TP2 intake
#: fixes (#434/#436), whose bounded controls do not qualify a full GLM serve.
#: Previously re-pinned
#: 2026-09-08 to 07ad344c3 (Tessera #431) for explicit packed checkpoint
#: execution and strict typed export carriers, retaining the exact contract
#: bytes and admission answer. Previously re-pinned
#: 2026-09-08 to 9d2314819 (Tessera #429) for bounded canonical Hessian
#: references and their nonblocking file refusal. The allocator/serving-cell
#: answer remains unchanged; the raw contract additionally records LFM
#: construction output sizes. The admission answer was last changed at
#: contract v22 / lane schema v9 (Tessera master 8ed1d9a, the merge of its
#: #332, which answers its #327; v21 landed at b8b1cb38 in its #313 and the
#: release e78959ed carried v20). At that review both pins were aligned on
#: b1eb1dccc: they name ONE object, and
#: letting them drift is how two of this repository's own spec files came to
#: disagree about one runtime.  Between the v17 review and this one the
#: answer moved in exactly four places and nowhere else -- no family, rung,
#: route status, launch, image or version moved, and the ten cell ids are the
#: same ten in the same order: the lane schema (v6 -> v8); every cell's
#: evidence gained ``smoke.attribution`` / ``smoke.control`` (v7) and
#: ``artifact`` (v8); every native extension gained its ``lane`` predicate
#: (v20); and the two ``routed_moe`` cells' ``smoke.status`` moved from
#: ``repetitive`` to ``recorded`` (v21, Tessera #313, receipt
#: ``docs/measurements/moe-smoke-recorded-2026-09-05.md``), with the v18
#: control retired from them (``attribution: unattributed``, ``control:
#: null`` -- the shape the BF16 cells already used).
#:
#: The answer below TRANSCRIBES what the runtime publishes, including its two
#: ``routed_moe`` cells.  Transcribing them does not admit them: admission is
#: a separate predicate (``lane_eligibility.cell_evidence_admits``) that
#: refuses on ``smoke.status`` alone.  Under v17 and v20 it refused both
#: routed-MoE cells on the degenerate greedy smoke the runtime recorded
#: (``repetitive``); under v21 the runtime records a smoke through the
#: checkpoint's own chat template that does not degenerate on either arm, the
#: status reads ``recorded``, and the SAME status-only rule admits both cells
#: with no predicate change here (prismaquant #198, option C).  That is the
#: mechanism working as designed: the evidence block is part of the answer,
#: so the clean smoke re-staled the pin and this literal's diff is the review
#: a human reads before anything is admitted.  Whether routed-MoE Tessera is
#: PROMOTED past the menu still requires the independent artifact and serving
#: gates; #198 records the resolved producer remeasurement decision.
#:
#: What moved v21 -> v22 (Tessera #332, answering its #327), and nothing
#: else -- same ten cell ids in the same order, no family, rung, route
#: status, launch, image or version:
#:   1. lane_schema v8 -> v9;
#:   2. every cell's ``evidence.smoke`` gained ``record`` -- ``null`` on the
#:      eight dense cells, and on the two ``routed_moe`` cells the
#:      instrument, the rule, the reference and the rows the status was
#:      derived over;
#:   3. those two cells' ``smoke.attribution`` moved ``unattributed`` ->
#:      ``shared_with_reference``, DERIVED from the record by Tessera's own
#:      ``derive_smoke_attribution`` rather than asserted.
#: Why that is a re-review and not a bump: at v21 the ``recorded`` status
#: rested on a repetition rule that lived only in a dated measurements file,
#: was checked by nothing, and was satisfiable by an empty completion
#: (Tessera #327, P1).  v22 puts the rule and its observations in the
#: contract, so the status this pin admits on is one a reader can re-derive
#: -- which ``lane_eligibility.parse_cell_evidence`` does, through Tessera's
#: ``derive_smoke_status``, refusing a published status the record does not
#: derive.  The admission itself is unchanged: ``cell_evidence_admits`` is
#: still status-only and still ``{repetitive}``.
#:
#: What moved v22 -> v23 (Tessera #456, merged as #464), and nothing else --
#: same ten cell ids in the same order, byte for byte, and no family, rung,
#: route status, launch, activation contract, image or version:
#:   1. lane_schema v9 -> v10;
#:   2. ``lane_eligibility.platforms`` entries stopped being bare keys. Each
#:      now carries ``backend`` (``cuda | hip``), exactly one of
#:      ``compute_capability`` / ``gcn_arch``, a ``serve_image`` that is a
#:      digest iff the platform has at least one cell and ``null`` otherwise,
#:      and ``executes`` -- a map over every family in ``formats[]`` whose
#:      value is that family's own route contract or ``null``;
#:   3. two AMD platforms arrived, ``gfx1151`` (Strix Halo, RDNA3.5) and
#:      ``gfx1201`` (RDNA4), with ``serve_image: null``, NO cells,
#:      ``TESSERA_BF16_K1`` backed and ``TESSERA_E4M3_K1`` /
#:      ``TESSERA_E2M1_K2`` ``null``.
#: Why the answer below moves by exactly ONE entry: the answer is the
#: projection an ADMISSION gate reads, and at this pin nothing here decides on
#: a platform's ``executes``.  The platform axis is published and admitted as
#: grammar; the first gate that reads it (the platform-aware serving route,
#: PrismaQuant #528) widens this projection, and widening a projection is its
#: own re-review by the rule stated above.  ``contract_version`` itself is not
#: in the answer (22 -> 23 alone would not have re-staled it); the lane schema
#: is, and a v10 document read by a v9-closed reader is refused by name, which
#: is the designed fail-closed rather than a compatibility break.
#:
#: The resident-H integration uses the reviewed runtime tree from Tessera
#: PR #441, which this pin supersedes without changing any priced byte: the
#: producer source identity changes and existing priced bytes keep their seal.
#: No release tag names this development commit.

#: The ANSWER this pin was reviewed against -- every value the ADMISSION
#: gate reads, in the vocabulary of :func:`contract_answer`.  This literal, not the file's
#: bytes, is what refuses: a Tessera commit that rewrites prose, reorders keys
#: or bumps ``contract_version`` publishes the same answer and does not
#: re-stale the pin, while any move in a family, a rate range, an attested
#: rung, a world-size ceiling, a cell, the canonical ``quant_method``, or a
#: published native extension (its prefix, its glob, the ``match`` rule, the
#: routes that need it, or what runs when it is absent) does -- with a
#: field-level diff naming it.  The git diff of this literal is the review.
#:
#: It also re-stales when the PROJECTION widens, which is the other half of
#: the same property: reading lane schema v9 gave ``CellEvidence.answer()`` a
#: seventh member for the smoke's record, and a reader that widened what it
#: looks at without re-reviewing would be admitting a field nobody had read.
#:
#: Against the v22 contract that seventh member is where the review is.  The
#: eight dense cells publish ``record: null`` and project a trailing ``None``,
#: so they did not move at all; the drift from the v21 answer was exactly
#: three entries -- ``lane_schema`` (v8 -> v9) and the two ``routed_moe``
#: cells, which gained the record and whose ``attribution`` moved
#: ``unattributed`` -> ``shared_with_reference`` because v9 DERIVES it from
#: that record.  Read those three and nothing else changed.

    """Exactly the values the gates on THIS pin decide on, canonicalised, and no more.

    Two gates read the dev pin: admission -- which ``(family, rate)`` the
    allocator may put on the menu and under which route status -- and the
    serve fingerprint's native-extension residency (prismaquant #133).  The
    answer is their union and nothing else.  It is deliberately NOT every
    value any PrismaQuant gate reads out of this file: ``lane_eligibility.structures``,
    ``platforms`` and ``regimes`` are read by the EXPORT lane's own reader
    (``tessera_export_lane.require_declared_structure`` through
    ``lane_eligibility.load_eligibility_table``), which is gated by the
    RELEASE pin -- an exact reviewed commit and contract SHA, refusing
    unresolved sentinels or mismatched installed contract bytes.  Pulling them in here would make an export-lane edit re-stale
    the allocator's menu, which is issue #38's own failure mode wearing a
    different hat.  Each pin covers the values its own gates read.

    Principle 14's line, made mechanical.  ``detail``, ``rationale``, the
    changelog and every other prose field explains; none of them is a value a
    gate reads, so none of them appears here.  Neither do ``contract_version``,
    ``plugin_version`` or ``default_serve_image``: those are the table's *identity*,
    which travels into provenance, and a version bump that moved no answer is
    not a thing to re-review.

    What is here is what a GATE decides on.  Most of it is the admission
    decision -- which families exist, the rate range the decoder accepts for
    each, the rungs a cell attests, the tensor-parallel ceiling, the canonical
    ``quant_method`` this producer writes into the checkpoint, and every cell
    field the route gate reads.  Two contracts with the same answer admit the
    same units.

    Schema v4's executed launches and residency scope are retained per cell.
    They identify which serving path the route claim covers; a changed
    decoder or narrowed residency therefore requires the same review as a
    changed rung, even when the cell's id and route status stay unchanged.

    ``native_extensions`` is here for a second gate, not the admission one:
    §7.4 says an A/B's arms must have identical native-extension residency,
    ``tools/serve_fingerprint.py`` decides residency by matching mapped
    libraries, and the prefix, the glob and the ``match`` rule are the values
    that decision is made of -- with ``when_unavailable`` the value that says
    what an ABSENT library means (a named substitute decoder, or no serve at
    all).  Those move the fingerprint's behaviour, so they are answer.
    ``source`` and ``loaded_by`` name files and modules in the runtime's own
    tree and move nothing on this side, so they are identity and stay out,
    exactly like ``plugin_version``.  ``lane`` (contract v20) IS answer: its
    ``decoder`` is what binds a cell's launch to the extension, and its
    ``requires`` is the predicate ``native_cells`` and the export gate
    decide this producer's plan against -- a lane that widens or narrows
    what it reads changes which rungs are admitted, and is a re-review.

    ``fused_module`` is here for a third (prismaquant #132): the group
    knapsack's fold reads it, so a contract that re-tightened ``q256`` to
    ``shared`` would change what this producer may allocate.  It carries
    exactly the block's values this reader parses -- see
    :class:`FusedModuleLicence` -- which is why ``container`` is NOT here.
    Nothing on this side reads the sidecar's magic (there is no Tessera export
    leg to write one with), and a value in the answer that no gate reads makes
    a re-review out of a field nobody uses.  The block's three ``*_note`` keys
    are prose and stay out for the same reason ``rationale`` does.

    That call does import the ``tessera.serving`` package, but the import is
    cheap by the runtime's own design: its ``__init__`` defines ``register()``

    scope, importing neither torch nor vLLM, so locating the contract
    registers nothing and needs no GPU.
    ``tests/test_tessera_serving_contract_path.py`` pins that property in a
    subprocess rather than in prose, so drift in the runtime's import
    behaviour fails a test instead of silently aging this docstring.  What a
    producer must not need is the serving-side *code*:
    ``tessera.serving.contract``'s validator imports the plugin's dispatch
    tables, which is a serving-side import a producer must not need on a
