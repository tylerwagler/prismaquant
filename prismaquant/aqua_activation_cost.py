"""AQUA-AURA: price the ACTIVATION side and merge it into a weight cost.

WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE STAGE
----------------------------
The allocator's cost was weight-only. Choosing NVFP4 does not just round the
weights to 4 bits -- on a lane that serves it fused, it is W4A4 and commits the
layer's ACTIVATIONS to 4 bits at serve time. FP8 commits them to 8. BF16 leaves
them alone. A weight-only surrogate is structurally blind to that difference
(NVFP4 and NVFP4A16 render weights bit-identically), so on such a lane the DP
was buying 4-bit formats at a discount to their true cost.

"ON A LANE THAT SERVES IT FUSED" IS LOAD-BEARING AND WAS ONCE MISSING HERE.
Whether activations are quantized is a property of the RUNTIME, not of the
format, and one lane can answer differently per FAMILY. Gridbook's CB runtime:

  * ``FP8_CB_*`` is genuinely W8A8 -- ``linear.py`` feeds quantized ``xq`` with
    per-token dynamic scales into ``native_cutlass_scaled_mm``, and ``moe.py``
    declares ``_FP8_GROUPED_CONTRACT = "fp8_per_token_dynamic"``. Real A-side.
  * ``NVFP4_CB_*`` is NOT -- it decodes to BF16 and runs a BF16 GEMM ("the
    exact native BF16 bridge") unless a PROCESS-GLOBAL env selector picks a
    fused mode, and every CB gate and gold serve leaves those unset. A-side
    exactly zero.

Charging the NVFP4 family a phantom A4 is not conservative, it is wrong in a
direction that costs bytes: it made FP8 look relatively cheap and the DSv4-Flash
92 GB body bought it, going from 96.8% ``nvfp4_cb`` (K16 bulk) to 25.4%
``FP8_CB`` with the bulk rung crushed K16 -> K12 -- paying weight bits to escape
a cost it never incurs. Keeping the REAL FP8 term is what stops the correction
from overshooting the other way. ``activation_dloss_table`` therefore REQUIRES
the lane's ``served_activation_quantization.executes`` (glob patterns over
format names) and refuses to guess it.

This stage uses a diagonal approximation that treats the activation term
separately from the weight term:

  * It needs NO render. ``activation_dloss`` reads the DENSE weight (as
    ``W[o,j]^2``), the card's ``g_sq_sum``, and the format's activation grid.
    The render basis never enters, so the number is identical whether the
    W-side was rendered with RTN or with the full GPTQ+JSO production recipe.
  * It therefore costs one streaming pass over the checkpoint and a row-blocked
    ``W^2 @ var`` per unit -- minutes, not the hours a render costs -- and it can
    be recomputed against any existing cost artifact without rebuilding it.

This computational separation does not establish that the actual errors are
independent. The approximation omits weight/activation interference and
channel correlations; its sensitivity card is not the KL/Gauss-Newton
adjoint used by AURA. Joint downstream pricing must project the full served
output residual before squaring (tracked in PrismaQuant #237).

That separate accounting is also the reason the term matters MORE than its size on an
RTN basis suggests: GPTQ and JSO shrink the W-side substantially and do nothing
whatever to the A-side. Measured on Qwen3.8-27B, production rendering cut
NVFP4's median W-side to 0.13x its RTN value while the A-side was unchanged, so
on the shipping render the activation term is several times the weight term for
the median Linear.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not choose formats and it does not rewrite an allocation. It writes one
number per (unit, format) into the cost rows and lets the DP do what it already
does. Hand-promoting the units it flags would be the post-allocator rewrite the
platform vetoes (principle 1): if the allocator picks something bad, the cost
model is what is wrong.

    """Map a card unit name to its checkpoint tensor key.

    These differ, and not cosmetically. A card's unit names come from the module
    tree the probe walked (``model.layers.7.mlp.gate_proj``), while a multimodal
    checkpoint nests the text tower one level deeper
    (``model.language_model.layers.7.mlp.gate_proj.weight``). Matching naively
    resolves a handful of units and silently prices almost nothing, which reads
    as "the menu is unavailable" rather than as a name mismatch.

    So index every ``.weight`` key under its own base name AND a de-nested
    alias. The alias is registered with ``setdefault`` so a real ``model.layers``
    key stays authoritative over one.

    THAT IS NOT ENOUGH IN GENERAL, and the de-nesting alias above is the tell:
    it is one architecture's rename hardcoded here. Some checkpoints rename the
    LEAVES too, not just the path. DSv4-Flash stores
    ``model.layers.0.mlp.experts.0.down_proj`` as
    ``layers.0.ffn.experts.0.w2.weight`` -- no ``model.`` prefix, ``mlp``
    renamed to ``ffn``, and the Mixtral ``w1/w2/w3`` leaf convention. No amount
    of path aliasing recovers that, and the failure is silent: resolution drops
    to 0/33325, every unit becomes unpriced, and because ``cost_entry_act_dloss``
    defaults to 0.0 the DP cannot distinguish "unmeasured" from "free".

    So when a ``profile`` is supplied, invert its own
    ``checkpoint_to_live_name`` over the weight map. That mapping is the
    architecture's declared, tested source-of-truth -- the same one the probe,
    the cost stage and the exporter resolve names through -- rather than
    another rename guessed here (principle 2: no heuristics when an explicit
    exists). Note the *forward* direction is not usable for this:
    ``source_tensor_name`` rewrites the path but not the leaf, so it yields
    ``layers.0.ffn.experts.0.down_proj``, which is not a key.

    ``activation_dloss`` needs the SOURCE weight as a dense float matrix, but a
    native-quantized checkpoint does not store one: DSv4-Flash keeps its routed
    experts as MXFP4 nibble-packs (int8 ``(out, in/2)`` + per-32 E8M0 scales)
    and everything else as block-FP8 (e4m3 + a 128x128 E8M0 scale grid).
    Reading those bytes as a weight is not approximately right, it is garbage
    -- the packed expert has half the columns and fp8 codes cast to float land
    in the code range, not the value range.

    DISPATCH IS DECLARATION-DRIVEN, NEVER SHAPE-INFERRED. ``fp8_map`` is the
    streaming loader's own ``_build_fp8_scale_inv_map`` product -- the same map
    the probe, the cost stage and the exporter loaded this model through -- so
    membership (and ``mxfp4_names``, and the dequant ``block``) come from the
    checkpoint's declarations, and this function's output agrees with the
    weights the loader installs. Decoders are REUSED, not re-derived:

      * MXFP4: ``mxfp4_widen.dequantize_mxfp4_source`` (documented mirror of
        ``layer_streaming._read_layer_to_device`` step 3b -- same LUT, same
        low-nibble-first order, same 0xFF NaN rule), in fp32. The loader's
        installed tensor is this value downcast to bf16.
      * block-FP8: ``layer_streaming._dequant_fp8_block_weight`` with the
        map's declared block. Torch decodes the ``float8_e8m0fnu`` scale in
        ``.to(bfloat16)`` (0xFF -> NaN included), and the aligned path is the
        same bf16 tile multiply as the loader's batched step 3, so the bf16
        result is bit-identical to the loader install; the fp32 upcast is
        lossless. Note the ``.scale`` sibling is a MULTIPLIER (the loader
        multiplies by it), despite the legacy ``scale_inv`` spelling.

    Every mismatch RAISES -- a unit this stage cannot materialize must never
    be silently skipped, because an unpriced A-side reads as 0.0 (= free) to
    the DP, which is the exact mispricing the stage exists to remove. And the
    encodings are uniform per tensor class, so the first bad unit means a
    systematic bug: dying on it costs seconds, not a wrong 33k-unit artifact.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-expert checkpoint layouts
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ``build_weight_resolver`` maps one card unit to ONE checkpoint key, which is
# right for a packed routed-expert parameter stored as a bare 3-D tensor
# (``...mlp.experts.gate_up_proj``).  GLM-5.3-Flash does not store it that way:
# every expert is its own 2-D ``nn.Linear`` weight
# (``...mlp.experts.{e}.gate_proj.weight``), and the fused gate/up pair is two
# tensors, not one.  So the 84 packed units of a 45-layer GLM body resolve to
# nothing -- 97% of the parameters -- and because ``cost_entry_act_dloss``
# defaults to 0.0 the DP cannot tell "unmeasured" from "free".  On a lane whose
# own attested contract says NVFP4 is "Real A4 on BOTH the dense and the
# packed-expert route", that is the DSv4 mispricing with the sign flipped: it
# makes the W4A4 rung look free exactly where it is not.
#
# The A-side math for packed units already exists and is tested
# (``_activation_dloss_packed``); only the checkpoint layout does not reach it.
# What follows is the bridge, and it STREAMS rather than stacking: the packed
# sum
#
#     dLoss ~= 0.5 / T_global * sum_e sum_o g_sq[e,o] * sum_j W[e,o,j]^2 var[e,j]
#
# is separable over ``e``, so a [288, 4096, 4096] gate_up never has to exist --
# it would be 19 GiB in float32, per format.  Each expert is promoted to
# float32 one at a time and reduced with ``_weighted_row_sum``, the same kernel
# and the same float64 accumulation the packed path uses, so this is the
# production quantity computed in a different order, not a second estimator.
