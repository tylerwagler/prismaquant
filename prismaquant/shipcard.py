"""The ship record (`exported/shipcard.json`) — a refusal contract.

R13 (`docs/audits/architecture_re-vet_2026-07-30.md`). The build lane and the
serve lane are separated by a physical boundary: `vllm` is not importable in the
build venv, so `run-pipeline.sh` cannot run a ship gate and never should. What it
*can* do is **open a record with required, empty slots** that only the serve lane
can close. `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli verify` then exits non-zero until every slot holds a
record whose `model_sha` matches the artifact on disk — which turns "we never ran
the gate" from a silent omission into an explicit refusal.

Lane-scoped slots (``shipcard.lane_scoped_slots()``, read as
:data:`LANE_SCOPED_SLOTS`) are opened by the lane's own
``lane_specs/<lane>.json`` ``gates[]`` and are required of cards stamped with
that ``lane``.  The vocabulary is derived from every lane spec, and each
derived slot names its replay in ``shipcard.LANE_SLOT_VERIFIERS`` (#162).

Base slots (required for every artifact):

| Slot | Filled by |
|---|---|
| `native_export.eager` | `validate_native_export.py --shipcard` (eager arm) |
| `native_export.graph` | `validate_native_export.py --shipcard --no-enforce-eager` |
| `ship_gate` | `validate_quantized_model.py --shipcard` |
| `gold.kl` | `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli fill --slot gold.kl --record <full_kl json>` |
| `gold.ppl` | `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli fill --slot gold.ppl --record <ppl json>` |

One lane-scoped slot, required only where it is definable — a **rate-axis**
artifact (today: the Tessera container), whose allocation is a claim that
choosing a rung per Linear beats spending the same bytes everywhere:

| Slot | Filled by |
|---|---|
| `uniform_control` | `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli fill-control` |

And one lane-declared evidence slot, required of cards stamped with the lane
that declares it — principle 12's second leg, the priced-vs-served route
comparison (#136, Tessera #126): the exact price/artifact/runtime-bound
census, or historical unscoped rows with their known substitute set:

| Slot | Filled by |
|---|---|
| `route.census` | `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli fill-route-census`, replayed from the carried records by `verify` |

That claim was measured false on 2026-09-02 (2.00x worse served KL than the
byte-matched uniform arm at 4.0 bpp) while every other check passed, so it is
a refusal here rather than a note. `shipcard_cli override-control` is the
deliberate, basename-confirmed, stamped escape hatch.

Until 2026-09-02 the retired Gridbook codebook lane opened three further
slots of its own (``perf.matched_budget_parity``, ``rtx4090.fp8_cb`` and the
DSv4 Gridbook gold contract).  They went into
``archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/`` with the lane: a slot no live lane can
open is a gate that only teaches operators to reach for
``--force-unverified``.  A previously shipped Gridbook artifact therefore no
longer re-verifies here; its card and the verifiers that read it are in the
archive.

The two `gold.*` slots additionally require `spec_decode_detected: false` on the
record that produced the number — vLLM routes echo+logprobs through the draft
model under `--speculative-config`, so a spec-decode-on gold number is the MTP
head's NLL, not the artifact's (§7.5).

Stdlib only, no torch: the CLI must run anywhere the artifact is reachable.

#: WHICH lanes open which slot is read from that lane's own ``gates[]``
#: (:func:`lane_gate_slots`); WHETHER a derived slot is admittable is read
#: from :data:`LANE_SLOT_VERIFIERS` -- the verifier :func:`verify` replays
#: for it, defined beside the verifiers below.  ``route.census``'s entry is
#: the #136 priced-vs-served replay.  A lane that declares a slot with no
#: verifier is REFUSED at parse time -- a slot with no verifier is a slot any
#: record closes -- so adding a fourth lane with a novel gate is one spec
#: file plus one verifier entry, and there is no second list to forget.

    Native artifacts once bound only ``config.json`` plus per-container SIZES,
    so the auxiliary files were unattested: swapping ``chat_template.jinja`` or
    ``tokenizer.json`` left the sha bit-identical. That is not cosmetic on a

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The byte-matched uniform control (#121, closing prismaquant#117 / tessera#1)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# An allocation over a rate *axis* is a claim: that choosing a rung per Linear
# beats spending the same bytes everywhere.  On 2026-09-02 that claim was
# measured and it was false -- a PrismaQuant-allocated Tessera checkpoint
# served 2.00x worse KL than a byte-matched uniform arm at 4.0 bpp (0.3485 vs
# 0.1746; 2.33x at 3.0, 2.88x at 5.0) while every other check the pipeline
# owns passed: 196/196 units matched the plan's bytes, a layer-0 re-encode was
# byte-identical, census read 112/112.  The pipeline computed one artifact
# correctly.  It was the wrong artifact.
#
# On 2026-09-03 an ORACLE handed the measured per-unit KL table reached only
# 0.941x the uniform control at 4.0 bpp, P(worse) = 0.075 -- not significant.
# So the closure is a REFUSAL, not a better cost model: there is no prize at
# that rung to fund one with.  Below the knee the axis is real (3.0 bpp:
# oracle 0.748x, AURA 0.780x, both P = 0.000), which is why this is a gate on
# the claim and not a verdict on allocation.
#
# Principle 3 applied to allocation itself: an allocation that cannot beat its
# byte-matched uniform control has not earned its allocation, and does not
# ship.  The lesson this is written against is that provenance nothing
# consumes is a confession log -- 73.7% of a 92 GB body once rode an
# `arch::Sm80` fallback on Blackwell, recorded in its own selection.json,
# refused by nothing.  So this REFUSES, in `verify`, at publication.
#
# How the record gets here:
#   1. Tessera builds and prices the control:
#        python experiments/uniform_control.py plan --plan-json <candidate plan>
#      then serves it, and `verify` re-asserts the byte match on the two
#      exported manifests.
#   2. The SAME KL tool that filled `gold.kl` is run on the control checkpoint
#      -- the control arm's record is gold-record shaped and is replayed
#      through `_verify_gold_record` below, so a last-token or weight-space
#      number cannot close this slot.
#   3. `python -m prismaquant.shipcard_cli fill-control` writes both, plus the
#      `tessera.control.control_block()` JSON, into the slot.

      the allocation rode an under-counted `k_proj`/`v_proj` `h_trace`, and
      the probe lane already refuses to PRODUCE such an allocation by default
      (`incremental_probe.kv_shared_fisher_block_reason`) — reaching export
      takes an explicit override, and publication past this gate takes the
      stamped `--force-unverified` hatch. Default-path cards echo `False`
      and are silent here.
    * The forensic hashes and counters are shape-replayed against what the
      producer can stamp (`file_sha256` emits 64 hex chars or None; the
      assignment digests are 16 hex chars or None; the histogram is a
      `Counter` rendering with positive counts), so a fabricated value is
      refused. Their preimages are build-machine-local (the recipe file is
      not shipped), so no offline cross-check exists for them — and none is
      pretended.
    * `source_model` / `layer_config` path strings are audit trail, not gate
      input: they name build-machine paths no verifier can resolve, and the
      same strings already travel in `mixed_native_manifest.json`. They are
      kept, labeled here as unread-by-design, rather than dropped.

    Every check fires only on a key the producer stamps, so a card written
    before a key existed is left alone — the same tolerance the
    `achieved_bpp` cross-check practices.

    """The claimed achieved bpp, cross-checked against the recipe's own bytes.

    The claim is whatever upstream stamped (see
    :func:`_allocator_achieved_bpp_claim`), and it is reported unchanged. What
    is added here is a ``cross_check`` block, because this exact class of
    defect has now shipped twice:

    * **Qwen3.8-27B arm B** — the card claimed the surrogate knee's 5.9994 for
      bytes that were the validated 4.7496 (1.25 bpp wide), which is what the
      ``selected_by`` precedence above was written to fix.
    * **DSv4-Flash `artifact-aura-cb-112p69`** — the card claimed 4.3065, read
      from a Pareto point (``allocator_target_4p5000_achieved_4p3065``) that
      was internally consistent but described an assignment that was **never
      exported**. The recipe it shipped prices to 2.7385. That is 57% wide and
      no precedence rule catches it, because the stale number is not the wrong
      *field* — it is the right field describing the wrong *point*.

    Both are the same failure: the label describes a different assignment than
    the recipe holds. A false public bpp silently breaks every matched-bpp
    comparison built on it, so it is worth a gate rather than a convention.

    The check is a **floor test**, not an equality test. The priced value is a
    lower bound (see :func:`recipe_priced_bpp`), so a claim below it is
    impossible and a claim far above it is describing something else. It is
    advisory here — :func:`verify` is where it refuses — so that a gate bug can
    never strand a finished export at card-writing time.

    The floor only bounds the claim when it covers nearly the whole recipe, so
    a mismatch under ``RECIPE_BPP_CROSS_CHECK_MIN_COVERAGE`` is reported as
    ``inconclusive_low_coverage`` and does **not** refuse. This is not
    timidity: the real ``allocation-112p69-raw`` recipe prices 70% of its units
    at 2.109 bpp and truthfully claims 2.755, because its unpriced units are
    plain NVFP4 at 4.25 bpp. A bare 10% test would have refused that correct
    artifact at publication — and a gate that false-refuses teaches the
    operator to reach for ``--force-unverified``, which is the worse outcome.

    Both directions are gated, including undershoot. See the comment in the
    body: "below the priced blend is impossible" holds only when every unpriced
    unit is higher-rate than the blend, the sound bound needs *parameter*
    coverage, and a non-CB unit records no shape in the recipe to compute it
    from.
