"""Vendored modeling code for architecture gaps and local compatibility fixes.

Currently:
- transformers_deepseek_v4/ — from transformers PR #45643 (Arthur Zucker's
  add-deepseek-v4 branch, vendored 2026-04-27). Required because DSv4 is
  the test target for the prismaquant DSv4-Flash-Base run.
- transformers_qwen3/ — local Qwen3 copy with RoPE cos/sin precomputed at
  init time to avoid deterministic cuBLAS NaNs in per-forward RoPE matmul.

Registering a vendored class is *verified*, never assumed. A registration that
silently fails to apply runs the probe on upstream modelling code — a numerical
change with no symptom — so every registration here re-resolves what the auto
classes will actually build and raises `VendoredOverrideError` if it is not the
vendored class. See `_force_auto_causal_lm_override`.
