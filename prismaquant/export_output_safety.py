"""Fail-closed output-path preflights shared by checkpoint exporters.

Exporters write large artifacts over many minutes or hours. Reusing a
non-empty destination can mix files from different source checkpoints, while
an output symlink (including a broken one) can redirect an owned write outside
the requested artifact. These helpers establish the production contract: the
source and output must resolve to different paths, directory outputs must be
new or empty, and file outputs must not already exist in any filesystem form.
