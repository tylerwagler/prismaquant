"""Per-family activation-fair pricing for weight-only cost rows (P5a).

Gridbook's ultraplan performance audit
(``docs/audits/ultraplan_perf_2026-08-01.md`` §6, "Three cost-model
asymmetries") names two defects in this producer's cost precedence:

1. **W4A4 vs W8A8 activation cost is priced only on the measured
   ``output_mse`` branch.** Packed experts (every production script sets
   ``PRISMAQUANT_EXPERT_COST_SAMPLE=16``, and ``measure_quant_cost`` writes
   ``output_mse_measured=False`` for every row of such a run) and
   ladder-interpolated rungs (``CB_LADDER_INTERP=1``; both the dense
   ``_ladder_metric_fit`` fills and the expert unit-KL rows are weight-only)
   fall through to the ``predicted_dloss``/``weight_mse`` branches, where the
   activation-contract difference is *structurally invisible*. NVFP4-CB gets
   credit for its cheaper index stream with none of its A-side cost, on most
   rows of a production run.
2. **The DP compares mixed estimators as if identical.** Anchors are
   activation-aware, interpolated rungs are weight-only, and nothing puts the
   two on one scale.

This module owns the fix's *math and policy*; ``allocator_candidates`` owns
the *extraction* (it is the module that knows the precedence chain) and calls
in. The dependency is deliberately one-directional — ``allocator_candidates``
imports this module, never the reverse — so there is no import cycle and the
calibration stays unit-testable without a cost pickle.

Functional form: a **per-family multiplicative factor, fit as the geometric
mean of the per-row estimator ratio**

    penalty(family) = exp( mean_i ln( d_measured_i / d_weight_only_i ) )

over every (Linear, format) row of that family where BOTH estimators exist.
``d_measured`` is the activation-inclusive price the ``output_mse`` branch
produces (``measure_quant_cost`` applies
``activation_quantize_dequantize(X)`` before measuring it, so it contains the
A side); ``d_weight_only`` is what the ``predicted_dloss``/``weight_mse``
branch would have priced the same row at. Four reasons for that form, in the
order they bind:

* **Transferability.** The correction must move from *measured dense rows* to
  *unmeasured packed-expert rows and interpolated rungs* — different shapes,
  different ``h_trace``, Δloss values orders of magnitude apart. A
  dimensionless ratio is the only form that transfers without a shared
  normalizer; an additive nats offset calibrated on attention rows is
  meaningless on an expert row.
* **It matches the estimator's own algebra.** Both branches are
  ``½·h_trace·MSE`` over the SAME ``h_trace`` (``allocator_solver.predicted_dloss``),
  so the ratio is exactly an MSE-space inflation factor — which is how the A
  side enters the Fisher expansion in the first place.
* **Heavy tails ⇒ geometric mean.** Δloss spans decades across layers; an
  arithmetic mean of ratios is set by a handful of high-``h_trace`` rows,
  while the correction is applied to all of them. The geometric mean is the
  MLE of a multiplicative factor under log-normal residuals, and it is the
  same log-space least squares the CB ladder law already uses
  (``expert_empirical_cost._cb_ladder_law``).
* **It cannot corrupt what is already validated** — *provided every rung of
  the family takes the same pricing branch* (see the correction below). A
  per-family constant applied uniformly cannot reorder rungs *inside* a
  family, so the holdout-gated ladder shape survives untouched; it re-levels
  families against each other, which is exactly the audit's complaint. And
  because it is multiplicative it cannot turn a 0.0 price into a nonzero one,
  so ``allocator_candidates.cost_entry_prices_unmeasured_activation_at_zero``
  — the existing candidate-removal gate — keeps precisely its current
  strength.

**Correction (2026-08-07), and the reason ``BRANCH_INTERPOLATED_OUTPUT``
exists.** That last bullet's premise did not hold as shipped. A family whose
rungs are priced on a MIX of branches — some from a measured ``output_mse``,
some weight-only — has the constant applied to only some of its rungs, and a
constant applied non-uniformly *does* reorder rungs inside the family. On
DSv4-Flash's ``nvfp4_cb`` menu the band-interpolated rungs (K13/K14/K17, stamped
``output_mse_measured=False``) fell to the weight-only branch while their
measured neighbours (K12/K15/K16/K18) did not, so the ladder was priced on two
scales at once. The applied constant is the family geometric mean — 2^6.81 =
112.5 on the bank it was diagnosed against — over a family whose true
``output_mse/weight_mse`` ratio runs 187–320 on gate/up_proj but only 9.4–22 on
down_proj: a ~20x spread inside one family, so no constant can serve it. That
over-priced down_proj rungs ~12x (the higher rung cost MORE than the lower one
on 85% of experts, so it could never be selected) and under-priced gate/up_proj
rungs ~1.6x. The menu was wrong in both directions at once, direction depending
on the projection.

The fix is not a better constant: a band-interpolated row is priced from its
OWN banked ``output_mse``, which is the tensor's holdout-gated ladder
interpolation *in output space* and therefore strictly better information than
any family aggregate. That restores one basis per family. Measured on the 32
banked DSv4-Flash layers, K13/K14/K17 against their neighbours: rung-order
violations fall from 84.8%/0%/84.6% (down_proj) and 2.5%/0%/3.5% (gate/up_proj)
to 0.014%/0.014%/0.043% on down_proj and exactly zero elsewhere, and the
price-vs-neighbour-geometric-mean ratio moves from 2.39x/2.34x/5.75x and
0.67x/0.65x/0.44x to within 1.5% of unity on every projection. The 5 residual
inversions in 63,459 comparisons are adjacent-rung ties of 0.02–0.53%, inside
the interpolator's own validated holdout error, which is the regime
``allocator_candidates.drop_interpolated_candidates_dominated_by_measured``
already owns. It does not make the row a measurement: the row keeps
``cost_source: band_interpolated`` and ``output_mse_measured: false``, it is
still barred from the calibration sample below (its ``output_mse`` is derived,
so admitting it would be circular), and it is stamped
``BRANCH_INTERPOLATED_OUTPUT`` rather than ``BRANCH_MEASURED``. The general
lesson is recorded here rather than in the NVFP4 code: ANY family that mixes
the measured and weight-only branches and has a heterogeneous ratio has this
defect. ``fp8_cb`` escaped it only because its interpolated rows happen to be
stamped ``output_mse_measured=True``, so its whole ladder took one branch.

What the factor actually measures, stated honestly: it is an
**estimator-transfer calibration**, not an isolated A-side term. The measured
branch differs from the weight-only branch by (a) the activation contract and
(b) output-space vs weight-space error propagation. Both differences are
family-structural — a W4A4 family and a W8A8 family differ in (a) by
construction — and both are exactly what makes the DP's mixed-estimator
comparison unsound. Naming it an activation penalty is the audit's framing;
naming it an estimator transfer is the mechanism.

Known, recorded bias: the A-side error is rung-INDEPENDENT while the W-side
shrinks with k, so the true ratio grows along a CB ladder. A per-family
constant therefore under-corrects the top rungs and over-corrects the bottom
ones *within* a family. That bias does not touch the cross-family verdict
this item exists to fix, and it is not hidden: ``FamilyCalibration`` records
the per-format mean log2-ratio and the spread across formats
(``rung_dependence_log2_range``), so a family whose ratio is strongly
rung-dependent is visible in the artifact. Making the correction rung-wise
would need a measured sample on the very rows that are unmeasured — the gap
being patched.

Kill switch: ``PRISMAQUANT_ACTIVATION_FAIR_PRICING=0`` restores pre-P5a
pricing bit-for-bit (and suppresses the fail-closed refusal below).
