"""Bit-rate (ship-bpp) selection for AURA — two principled selectors, no kneedle.

The 2026-06 Aura work showed the surrogate rate-distortion curve is a clean
exponential (KL ~ 10^(-a*bpp), straight in log-KL), so there is **no intrinsic
knee**: the classic kneedle picks the point of maximum curvature, which on a
log-linear curve is purely an artifact of how you scale the axes (KL vs log-KL,
bpp vs bytes — the 27B knee moved 7.5 -> 12 bpp across axis choices). The ship
bpp is therefore not a curvature to find; it is set by one of two real anchors:

  * CONSTRAINED ("fit the card") — ``select_under_byte_budget``: you target a
    GPU SKU (24/32 GB). Feasibility is exact and needs no KL measurement: an
    allocation ships only if its *exact* exported footprint
    (``prismaquant.footprint``) fits the budget. Among the rungs that fit,
    ``allocator.main`` ships the one with minimum predicted Δloss (ties to the
    larger footprint) — NOT simply the densest, because the RD curve is not
    monotone in bytes (§5: 5.5 bpp beat 6.0 bpp on measured 4B PPL). This is
    the real ship selector.

  * UNCONSTRAINED ("where do bits stop paying") — ``find_saturation_bpp``: with
    no byte budget, pick the *saturation* point on the **measured** distortion:
    the lowest bpp whose distortion is statistically indistinguishable (within
    z * combined stderr) from the high-bpp asymptote. The only non-arbitrary
    stopping anchor is the measurement noise floor — you cannot ship a quality
    gain you cannot distinguish from sampling scatter. One knob (z, a
    significance level — not a curvature unit), unit-free, anchored to a real
    quantity. It scans the candidate grid rather than assuming monotonic noisy
    measurements; when called from validated-frontier selection the grid has
    already been measured. NB: the band is z * combined stderr, so the measured
    frontier must carry a real per-bpp stderr (calib-repeats >= 4, or a
    per-position bootstrap); a single-rep stderr of 0 collapses the band so that
    only the asymptote is within-noise of itself, degenerating B* to the
    highest-bpp asymptote (the densest / safest allocation, i.e. ship the most
    bits) — not lowest-bpp.

Both are selectors over Pareto candidates (never a post-allocator rewrite), in
the spirit of the kneedle they replace.

    ``candidates`` is the Pareto set, each a mapping carrying at least the
    exported on-disk size (``bytes_key``); ``bpp_key`` / ``loss_key`` are used
    only for tie-breaking and reporting (a missing loss is treated as +inf).
    The chosen point is the one with the **largest footprint that still fits**
    the budget — the most bits you can afford. Ties on bytes break to lower
    loss, then higher bpp.

    IMPORTANT — this function is the FEASIBILITY GATE, not the ship objective.
    "Fill the card" would be the quality-optimal feasible point only if the RD
    curve were monotone in bytes, and it is not: CLAUDE.md §5 records 5.5 bpp
    beating 6.0 bpp on measured Qwen3-4B PPL, and since the solver began
    ratcheting on minimum predicted Δloss among feasible iterates, a denser
    rung can carry a strictly worse Δloss than a sparser one that also fits.
    The shipping selector in ``allocator.main`` therefore uses this function's
    ``feasible`` / ``below_floor`` verdict and its candidate set, but picks by
    **minimum predicted Δloss among the rungs that fit** (ties to the larger
    footprint) and records that objective in ``selection.json``
    (``ratchet_objective``). ``chosen`` is still returned, and the allocator
    records it as ``max_bytes_pick_*`` so the two objectives stay auditable
    side by side.

                           densest allocation; ``slack_bytes`` is the unused room),
