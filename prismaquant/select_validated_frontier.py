    anything is the noise of the statistic itself. `--calib-repeats` already
    re-measures every row on independent calibration draws, so each tail

    ``rows`` must already be sorted by (bpp, kl); a point enters the envelope
    only when it improves the running best KL by more than the noise floor.

    **Tail veto (D1/R9).** CLAUDE.md §5 rule 4: KL is a *screening* metric, and
    a lower mean can hide a heavier tail — the shipped 27B PrismaSCOUT has a
    worse max-prompt NLL than the artifact it beat on mean KL. With
    ``tail_veto`` naming a column (``kl_p99``/``kl_max``/``nll_p99``), a row
    that improves mean KL is admitted only if its tail also holds:
    ``row[tail] <= incumbent[tail] * (1 + tail_eta)``. The incumbent is the
    last admitted frontier point, so the tail is required to be non-increasing
    along the envelope exactly as the mean is.

    ``tail_eta`` is a number, or ``"auto"`` — the derived slack, recomputed
    against each incumbent as that row's between-repeat relative stderr (see
    ``tail_eta_auto``). ``"auto"`` on a row with a single calibration repeat is
    a strict 0; the CLI says so out loud.

    ``tail_veto=None`` (and ``--tail-veto none``) is byte-identical to the
    pre-R9 behavior — no column is read and no row is vetoed. The CLI default
    is ``kl_max`` (ruled 2026-07-30); vetoed rows are appended to ``vetoed``
    with a ``veto_reason`` so a rejection is visible in the summary rather than
