"""Tessera's grid-space, in the shape PrismaQuant's rate-distortion allocator wants.

This module is the seam that replaces ``trellis_formats`` (archived
2026-09-02 under ``archive/trellis_wire_2026-09-02/``, #118).  The story is
worth stating because the diff looks bigger than the change is.

``trellis_allocator`` (1768 lines) and ``trellis_rate_surface`` (876) were
written for the Gridbook rate-256 tail-biting trellis, but neither file mentions
Gridbook or TCQ even once: they are exact-marginal pricing, Pareto frontiers,
lambda choice, RD hulls, leave-one-anchor-out and allocation regret -- pricing
machinery that happens to have been pointed at a trellis.  Between them they
consume exactly **five** and **seven** names from ``trellis_formats``, and the
load-bearing one is a frozen dataclass describing a *family*.

So retiring the Gridbook attempt does not mean deleting the pricing.  It means
pointing that seam at Tessera.

**This is not building Tessera out of Gridbook's internals.**  The direction is
the opposite one: the pricing machinery is PrismaQuant's, the format authority
is Tessera's, and the Gridbook-specific vocabulary is what gets walled off.
Nothing here reimplements Tessera -- every number is read from the ``tessera``
package, and a second copy of a rate constant is a drift bug waiting for a rate
to change.

The space, and why it is continuous
-----------------------------------
A family is a **(base grid, arity)** pair.  A base grid of ``G`` codes at arity
``k`` gives a code space of ``G**k``, so ``payload_bits = k*log2(G)``, and the
rate cap is a property of the *body* the family's wire recipe names: the TCQ
trellis spends one payload bit on its convolutional code, so its cap is
``payload_bits - 1`` (``|A_R| * |D(a)| = 2^(R+1) * 2^(cap-R)`` has to close at
``2^payload_bits`` exactly), while the WINDOW body shapes with history rather
than a code bit and caps at ``payload_bits``.  Ask :func:`family_rate_cap`,
never the subtraction.  A code covers ``k`` positions, so the
per-position body rate is ``rate/k`` -- which is how ``k=2`` fills the rungs
between the ``k=1`` ones, and how 4.0 bpp becomes addressable at all.

Within a family the rate axis is **continuous at a 1/256-bpp quantum**, not a
handful of rungs.  A root rate is realised as a mixed per-column Bresenham
schedule, and a root is realisable over ``n`` columns exactly when
``(root - floor(root)) * n`` is an integer.  Rates are quoted in q256 -- 256ths
of a bit -- and the superblock is 256 columns, so that product is
``root_q256 mod 256``, an integer by construction.  **The q256 grid is exactly
the realisable set at superblock scale.**  Verified exhaustively: ~9500 rungs
across ten families spanning 1.00 to 8.00 bpp, zero unrealisable
(``tessera/tests/test_grid_space_continuity.py``).

Realisability is not quality.  This module says which rungs can be *encoded*;
which are worth encoding is a measurement, and only four of them have one.

    ``lru_cache`` fixes its size when the decorator runs, which for a bound

    builds every grid in it, and a module import may not do that.  So the memo
    is built on the first call and the wrapper forwards ``cache_info`` and

    live memo instead of restating it, and what makes a cleared memo pick up a
    bound that has since moved.

    A bound that asks the memo it is sizing is refused rather than quietly
    answered uncached: that is a design error in the bound (the sizing would
    recurse), and hiding it behind a fallback would hide the one thing this
    wrapper cannot fix.  :func:`recipe_cache_bound` is deliberately stated

    pass over the space is still filling (tessera#46).  **It is not

    same drift one level up.

    The interval is counted at the **grammar's** cap, ``payload_bits`` per
    code, rather than at :func:`family_rate_cap`'s recipe-dependent one, for
    two reasons and neither is slack:

    * ``family_rate_cap`` reads the family's recipe, i.e. it calls

      scheduled TCQ -> WINDOW move is one) moves the reachable set and does not
      move this number.

    14,988 against 13,068 today -- and that costs nothing: ``lru_cache`` does
    not preallocate, so an entry exists only once a key is asked.

    Five terms, one per thing the wire charges that is not a body bit:

    * **span labels.**  A span-L trellis stores one select bit per L *codes*
      instead of one per code and ``L - 1`` two-bit labels: ``(L - 1) / L``
      extra bits per code, i.e. per ``arity`` positions.  A WINDOW body has no
      super-symbols and pays none of it.
    * **a block scale plane**: a flat ``SCALE_PLANE_BITS_Q256`` (S6b) or
      ``SCALE_LUT_BITS_Q256`` (LUT).
    * **a CHANNEL scale plane**: 16 bits per output *row* on DIAG_SV, which is
      ``16 / columns`` per position -- a per-unit cost, so it needs ``shape``.
    * **a WINDOW body's table**: ``code_bytes * 2^window_bits`` bytes inline
      on the ALPHABET plane, ``8 * code_bytes * 2^L / (rows * columns)`` per
      position -- likewise per-unit, likewise needs ``shape``.  The width is
      the *grid's* (``PayloadGrid.code_bytes``), not a constant: a code is as
      wide as the code space, and BF16's code IS a bf16 word, so its table is
      two bytes an entry.  ``tessera.calculator.terminal_rate`` takes the same
      figure from the same place, which is what keeps this accountant and the
      wire agreeing byte for byte on the 16-bit route.
    * **a TCQ body's forest**: the ALPHABET plane holds ``2^(R+1)`` anchor
      codes and the DESCENDANT plane ``2^(cap+1)`` bytes, once per *distinct*
      rate the schedule uses, both written inline in the unit
      (``tessera.unit_artifact._forest_planes``).  Sized by
      :func:`tessera.grammar.forest_plane_bytes`, **called and not restated**:
      a second implementation of one accountant is the defect this term is
      here to repair, and Tessera's is the one the exporter writes with.  It
      needs the ``rung`` as well as the ``shape``, because the forest is a sum
      over the schedule's distinct rates and an arity-1 schedule that spans
      two of them carries two forests -- which is why R511 outweighs the
      uniform R512 above it.

    ``shape`` is ``(rows, columns)`` in **weight** space, and a recipe with a
    per-unit term and no shape **raises** rather than dropping the term.  That
    is now *every* recipe: a WINDOW body has its table, a CHANNEL plane its
    row field, and a TCQ body its forest, so no Tessera rung has a
    bits-per-parameter rate and every synthesized ``FormatSpec`` prices
    through ``bits_for_shape_fn``.  A floor is not an acceptable substitute:
    the only consumer of a shape-free value was
    ``FormatSpec.exact_bits_per_param``, which ``memory_bytes_for_shape``
    multiplies by the parameter count as an exact rate, and a ``Fraction``
    cannot carry "this is a floor".  Returning the floor there is the drop,
    not the guard against it.

    Until 2026-09-03 this had four terms and no forest, and the docstring said
    "nothing raises today -- every family's recipe is TCQ over a block plane".
    That sentence was the bug: TCQ over a block plane is exactly the wire that
    was being priced 512 bytes light (RobTand/prismaquant#126), and the
    accountant's own shape-free branch was what hid it.

    At ``span=1, s6b`` the block-plane term is the half-bit every pre-minor-1
    figure carried.

    ``recipe`` -- or the ``span``/``scale_plane`` scalars, which override the
    fields they name -- defaults to what the tessera exporter writes for this
    family at this rung (``tessera_wire_recipe``): since 2026-09-01 a span-2
    trellis over a LUT plane, which at ``E2M1_K2_R896`` is 3.75 body + 0.25
    plane -- the same position-domain size as the span-1 S6b wire it replaced,
    at 1.125x lower output-space error on the GLM experts (tessera
    ``experiments/tessera_wire_default_check.py``).  On an arity-1 family the
    stored labels cost 0.25 more per position than the LUT plane saves, so
    those rungs weigh 0.25 bpp more than they did.

    **4.0 is not the artifact's rate, and quoting it as one was #126.**  On
    top of the position planes a TCQ body writes its forest -- 512 bytes at
    the E2M1x2 coset cap -- per *unit*, so R896 is 4.0556 bpp on a 96x768
    expert, 4.1333 on a 96x320 one and 4.0013 on a 1024x3072 dense Linear.
    That is why ``shape`` is not optional.

    The rate is **two-dimensional**.  A column at body rate ``R`` writes ``R``
    body bits and may spend up to ``cap - R`` further bits selecting among the
    descendants its trellis subset reaches; the encoder spends
    ``min(completion, cap - R)`` of them.  ``completion=0`` is the exporter's
    default and the measured optimum -- at every matched artifact size, body
    rate buys more accuracy than completion depth does (up to 1.4x on
    ``E2M1_K1``) -- and ``None`` means full depth, where body + completion sum
    to ``cap`` and every rung of a family weighs the same.

    ``shape`` is ``(rows, columns)``, and it is required on **every** recipe,
    because every recipe charges something per unit rather than per position:
    a CHANNEL scale plane's row field, a WINDOW body's table, or a TCQ body's
    forest.  Without it they raise; see :func:`wire_overhead_q256` for why a
    documented floor would be the silent drop rather than the guard against
    it.  Under a WINDOW body ``completion`` must be 0: the window table is
    flat, not a forest.

    That last sentence was, from 2026-09-01 until later the same day, this
    function's entire contract: it returned the family's cap regardless of the
    rung, because the serialiser wrote the COMPLETION plane at full width
    whatever depth the encoder used, so the ladder really was flat on disk.
    That was a bug in three places (tessera `a96064b`, `eec18ba`) and not a
    property of the format.  Both errors are worth remembering, because they
    point opposite ways: quoting ``(q256+128)/256`` against a full-width
    completion plane underpriced R256 by 133%, and quoting the cap against an
    honest one overprices it by the same amount.  The size is what the
    accountant writes, and the accountant now follows the spend.

    dispatches on.  For every stock format that thing is the format itself,
    and this function returns the name unchanged -- so a menu with no Tessera
    rung in it promotes exactly as it did before this function existed.

    A Tessera rung is two facts glued into one name: the **family**
    (``TESSERA_E2M1_K2``), which is the grid and arity the decoder is compiled
    for, and the **rung** (``_R896``), which is a point on that family's
    continuous rate axis.  Only the first is a dispatch property.  Returning
    the family lets promotion require the shared decoder while leaving the
    rate free per member -- which is the whole reason a continuous axis is
    worth having, since q_proj (2048x1024) and k_proj (1024x1024) are
    different tensors with different sensitivities fused into one qkv_proj.

    Pure string work on the same anchored grammar
    (:data:`_FORMAT_NAME`) the parser uses, deliberately: promotion runs
    inside the numpy DP and must not pay for a grid build, and a second copy

       This function is a *name* projection and nothing more.  Whether a

       family is a fact about that runtime, and it is **not** decided here: it
       is published, per field, in the Tessera contract's ``fused_module``
       block (``q256: per_member`` since contract v6, RobTand/tessera#37) and
       read through ``tessera_menu.fused_module_licence`` -- that module's declared
       one read.  The group
       knapsack folds over that block and holds every ``shared`` field fixed
       -- including ``body`` and ``plane``, which the family alone does NOT
       fix, because ``wire_recipe`` is a function of ``(grid, q256)``; see
       :func:`fused_shared_signature`.  Returning the family here is what lets
       ``allocator_solver`` promote a unit onto one decoder; it is not a claim
       that the rate is free, and callers must not read it as one.

       Principle 9's export gate still decides whether such an assignment
       ships, and ``mixed_rung_receipt`` is ``false``: no vLLM serve has
