"""Expected per-token decode READ bytes for a quantization assignment.

Why this exists
---------------
The allocator minimizes KL under a **disk-byte** budget.  Decode throughput
is not governed by disk bytes: it is governed by the bytes the serving
runtime must actually stream *per generated token*.  On a sparse MoE those
two objectives diverge violently, because a dense weight is read on every
token while a routed expert stack is read only when the router selects it.

Measured 2026-08-21 on the shipped DSv4-Flash 87 GB artifact: the dense path
is **8.3% of the checkpoint but 76.8% of decode read traffic**, and the whole
artifact costs **8.0576 GB read per token** at batch 1.  A byte budget cannot
see that, so it systematically overspends decode bandwidth on the dense path.
This module is the *measurement* half of closing that gap (principle 1: it is
a measurement gap, not an optimizer gap).  It deliberately changes no
allocation; pricing read bytes inside the DP is a separate decision.

                                                    per-token stream traffic
===========================  =====================  ==========================

``topk / E`` is exact as an *expectation* under the per-layer-uniform serving
invariant PrismaQuant already enforces (experts are uniform per layer, mixed
across layers): every expert in a layer's stack stores the same bytes, so
routing skew redistributes which experts are read without changing the
expected bytes read.  Where a lane breaks that invariant — a CB split-stack
whose sub-stacks carry different bytes per expert — the number becomes an
expectation under *uniform* routing and says so in ``routing.exactness``.

The embedding is excluded because it is *gathered*, not streamed — but that
is only true while it is nothing else.  Under ``tie_word_embeddings`` the same
table **is** the output projection, and the logits matmul streams all of it on
every token.  Which case an artifact is in is decided by observation, not by
name: the logits projection is streamed exactly once per token, so the
embedding is excluded when the checkpoint carries a separate ``lm_head``
tensor and is ``held_fixed`` when it does not; ``resolve_embedding_disposition``
is where that is decided.  The config's ``tie_word_embeddings`` is the
cross-check, and a
config that declares *untied* on a checkpoint with no output projection raises
rather than picking one of the two stories.  Excluding a tied table would drop
one of the largest always-active tensors in the model (Qwen3-0.6B ties; so
does LFM2.5).

Indexed lookup tables take **three** facts, not one
---------------------------------------------------
An integer tensor is not automatically an index table, and each weaker rule was
falsified on a real artifact before this one was settled:

* *dtype only* — the packed weight payload of both quantized lanes is an
  integer dtype and is streamed in full (``U8`` is 81.65 GB of ``cb_qweight``
  on the shipped DSv4 CB body and 15.7 GB of NVFP4 ``weight_packed`` on
  Ornith-1.5-35B).  Classifying by dtype alone excludes 94% of that artifact.
* *dtype + vocabulary-keyed leading axis* — a **quantized ``lm_head``** is
  both, and it is streamed in full.  On the `embed-smoke` CB-head export that
  rule dropped 857,736 B of real logits traffic: an **under**-count, the
  dangerous direction.

So ``excluded_indexed_lookup`` requires all three: *integer dtype* (it cannot
be a float matmul operand on its own) **AND** ``shape[0] == vocab_size`` (a
decode step addresses one row by token id) **AND** *the module is not declared
a quantized weight* — neither by a float scale sidecar (nothing turns those
integers into numbers) nor by the artifact's own
``config_groups[*].targets``.  Both halves of the third fact are needed: a CB
payload keeps its scales in the codebook sidecar, so ``lm_head.cb_qweight`` has
no scale tensor in the shard set at all, and only the declared ``targets:
["lm_head"]`` covers it.  Everything is read from the safetensors headers and
the artifact's own config; the scale suffixes come from
``footprint._SIDECAR_SUFFIXES``, the constant the byte partition already folds
on.  DSv4's ``ffn.gate.tid2eid`` — I64 ``[129280, 6]``, token id to its six
expert ids, no scale on ``ffn.gate`` and no target naming it — is the case that
survives all three.

The residual direction is deliberate: anything the three facts cannot establish
stays in ``held_fixed`` at ``p=1``, which **over**-counts read traffic.  For a
bandwidth figure that is the safe direction, and it is the opposite of the
failure this module exists to prevent.

Honest defaults for the genuinely ambiguous classes
---------------------------------------------------
The MTP sidecar is read every token when the artifact is served with
spec-decode and never when it is not, and nothing in the recipe says which.
It is **excluded but itemized** (``excluded.mtp_bytes``) so a caller serving
with spec-decode can add it back exactly.  The same applies to vision/audio
towers, which a text decode never touches.  Nothing is silently dropped: the
ledger reconciles against ``footprint.assignment_artifact_bytes`` to the byte
before any probability is applied, and refuses if it does not.

Scope
-----
Weights only, batch 1, greedy decode.  KV-cache traffic, activations, and
safetensors container metadata are outside it — so a figure from here is a
**lower bound** on real decode traffic, which is the honest direction for a
bandwidth ceiling.

    Three facts, all read off the safetensors headers and the model config,
    and **all required**:

    1. the dtype is an integer type, so the tensor cannot be a float matmul
       operand *on its own*;
    2. its leading axis is the vocabulary, so a decode step addresses one row
       of it by token id -- exactly the reason the embedding is excluded; and
    3. its module is **not declared a quantized weight** -- neither by a float
       scale sidecar (nothing turns those integers into numbers) nor by the
       artifact's own ``config_groups[*].targets``.

    Each of the first two was measured to be insufficient alone, on real
    artifacts:

    * dtype only -- the packed weight payload of both quantized lanes is
      ``U8`` (81.65 GB of ``cb_qweight`` on the shipped DSv4 CB body, 15.7 GB
      of NVFP4 ``weight_packed`` on Ornith-1.5-35B), streamed in full.  A
      dtype-only rule excludes 94% of that artifact.
    * dtype + vocabulary axis -- a **quantized ``lm_head``** is integer-dtyped
      *and* vocabulary-keyed, and it is streamed in full.  On the
      `embed-smoke` CB-head export that two-fact rule dropped 857,736 B of
      real logits traffic, an **under**-count: the dangerous direction.
    * the scale-sidecar half of fact 3 alone -- a CB payload keeps its scales
      in the codebook sidecar, so ``lm_head.cb_qweight`` has no scale tensor
      in the shard set; the artifact's declared ``targets`` is what covers it.

    What survives all three is DSv4's ``ffn.gate.tid2eid`` -- I64
    ``[129280, 6]``, token id -> its six expert ids, no scale anywhere on
    ``ffn.gate`` and no quantization target naming it -- which is the case the
    rule was derived from.

    The residual is deliberate and one-directional: an integer table keyed by
    anything other than the vocabulary, or one that happens to sit under a
    quantized module, stays in ``held_fixed`` at ``p=1`` and **over**-counts.

    no output projection is a contradiction, and one of the two descriptions

    ``assignment`` is the allocator's *expanded*, post-promotion per-Linear
    recipe (fused-sibling and packed-MoE coupling already reflected) and
    ``stats`` the probe's per-Linear stats, exactly as
    :func:`footprint.assignment_artifact_bytes` takes them -- and that
    function is this one's byte authority.  Stored bytes for an assigned unit
    come from :func:`footprint.format_tensor_payload_breakdown` (the shared
    per-unit primitive that already prices NVFP4 group scales, FP8 row
    scales, and CB index/row-scale/layout bytes); stored bytes for every
    tensor the allocator never decided come from the checkpoint's own
    safetensors spans via :func:`footprint.source_tensor_span_bytes`.

    The two halves are then **reconciled against the whole-assignment
    footprint before any read probability is applied**, and a mismatch of a
    single byte raises.  That is what makes this a re-use of the footprint
    accounting rather than a second copy of it: the ledger cannot drift
    without failing.

    Returns a dict with ``read_bytes_per_token`` / ``read_gb_per_token``, the
    four-key ``breakdown`` (dense / routed / held_fixed / resident_codebooks),
    the itemized ``excluded`` bytes, the ``routing`` factor and its
    provenance, per-class totals, and the ``reconciliation`` block.  CB
    assignments require ``cb_serialization_context`` for the same reason
    ``assignment_artifact_bytes`` does.
