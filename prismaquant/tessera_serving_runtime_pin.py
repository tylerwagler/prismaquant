"""Strict, torch-free reader for PrismaQuant's Tessera serving-runtime pin.

Tessera serves ITSELF.  Since 2026-09-02 the Tessera repository ships its own
vLLM plugin -- package ``tessera.serving``, entry point
``tessera = "tessera.serving:register"`` under
``[project.entry-points."vllm.general_plugins"]``, registering
``quant_method = "tessera"`` -- so the runtime that reads Tessera bytes is
Tessera's, not Gridbook's.  Gridbook's Tessera lane is withdrawn; its contract
v14, which carried the two Tessera rows, was never released, so nothing that
shipped is broken by the move.  This module is the producer side of the new
boundary and it is deliberately the same shape as
``gridbook_serving_runtime_pin.py``: PrismaQuant never vendors or imports the
serving runtime's *serving* half, and compatibility crosses the repository
boundary through exactly two objects -- this immutable pin, and the contract
the runtime packages (``tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json``, read through
``importlib.resources``).

**THE PIN IS AN EXACT COMMIT PLUS THE CONTRACT'S DIGEST -- NOT A TAG.**
Until 2026-09-04 this pin required a Tessera RELEASE, and admission was
fail-closed because no tag existed.  Rob's instruction retired that:
*"can we just pin prismaquant to latest version of tessera? then we won't have
to keep cutting releases."*  "Latest" is read here as **an exact commit plus
the packaged contract's raw SHA-256**, never as a floating ref.  A floating
ref (``main``, "an installed source tree", "whatever imports") is precisely
the failure principle 14 exists to prevent, and this module's own history
names it: admission would flip to True the moment somebody put the Tessera
source tree on ``PYTHONPATH``.

Immutability now comes from those two values rather than from a tag, and the
DIGEST is the enforced half.  PrismaQuant cannot verify a sibling checkout's
git history from inside its own process -- a commit string is a claim about
another repository -- but it CAN hash the contract bytes it is about to read,
which is the only thing about the runtime a gate here actually consumes.  So:

* :data:`TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_CONTRACT_SHA256` is checked against
  the installed ``tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json``, byte for byte, and
  a mismatch REFUSES.  A stray Tessera checkout on ``PYTHONPATH`` whose
  contract is not the pinned one is refused exactly as a PENDING pin was.
* :data:`TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_COMMIT` is recorded identity: it says
  which reviewed Tessera commit those bytes came from, so a shipcard and a
  human can find the tree, and so ``git`` can settle any question the digest
  raises.  The two are bound at review time by one command
  (``git -C <tessera> show HEAD:src/tessera/serving/runtime_contract.json |
  sha256sum``), which is what the pin's provenance records.

**``version_is_release`` is ADVISORY.**  It is still required, still parsed,
still recorded, and it still cannot be ``true`` over a PENDING commit -- so it
keeps saying something true for an actual release.  What it no longer does is
GATE: requiring it would re-impose the tag Rob just removed, and the
immutability it was standing in for is now carried directly by the digest.

**Moving the pin is ONE reviewed change, not three.**  Following the Gridbook
discipline (a pin whose schema, version, commit and digest cannot move by
halves), moving it means editing, in a single commit: the JSON pin's
``commit``/``version``/``contract_sha256``, AND the module constants
:data:`TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_VERSION` /
:data:`TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_COMMIT` /
:data:`TESSERA_SERVING_RUNTIME_PINNED_CONTRACT_SHA256` below.  The reader
requires the pin to equal the constants, so a JSON edit alone cannot admit
anything and a constant edit alone cannot either.

**THE EXTENSION TABLE IS TRANSCRIBED, AND REFUSED AGAINST ITS SOURCE.**
``serving_native_extensions`` is not this repository's opinion about which
CUDA extensions the Tessera plugin loads: since Tessera contract v7 the
runtime publishes that itself, in ``native_extensions``, as a
``module_name_prefix``/``filename_glob``/``match`` triple plus the
``when_unavailable`` block saying what a serve does when the library is
absent.  The pin transcribes all four because
``tools/serve_fingerprint.py`` runs inside a serving container from
a bootstrap with no installed package and can read neither the contract nor
this reader module -- but the pin is JSON, so the tool reads the transported
pin file beside itself (a member of its gold-producer source closure, hence
digest-covered) and refuses a missing or malformed one instead of falling
back to a constant -- and
``tessera_runtime_contract.require_pin_native_extensions_match_contract``
refuses a transcription that is not the pinned contract's table.  So the chain
is contract -> pin -> fingerprint with a refusal at each link, instead of a
refusal at the last link only.  It used to be the last link only, and the
hand-written value was already wrong by one character: the pin said
``"tessera_nvfp4"`` where the load path's constant is ``"tessera_nvfp4_"``.

**No wheel digest, and why.**  Gridbook's serving pin additionally binds an
exact reviewed wheel SHA-256, because Gridbook is installed into a serving
container from a published archive.  Tessera's plugin is installed from a
source checkout (``pip install --no-deps --no-build-isolation -e <tessera>``)
and publishes no wheel, so asserting a digest here would be a claim about an
artifact that does not exist.  The commit is the binding fact and it is the one
this pin carries; when Tessera starts publishing wheels, a ``wheel_sha256``
member is added here and to the JSON in the same reviewed commit.

**A consequence worth stating.**  Under commit pinning, a developer checkout
of Tessera that has moved past the pin makes this repository's Tessera tests
go RED, by design: the installed contract is not the pinned contract, and
fail-closed is the whole point.  The fix is environmental -- install Tessera
at the pinned commit -- never a check that reads whatever is installed.

**``repository`` names the origin the pin was reviewed from.**  It is the
reviewed identity of the runtime, not a reachability claim, and no gate here
fetches from it.

#: Re-pinned 2026-09-05 to ba582d4 (Tessera #356) for the priced-input
#: exporter snapshot API required by PrismaQuant #231. The v22 contract bytes
#: and reviewed admission answer are unchanged. Producer API dependencies can
#: require a newer pin even when the published runtime contract is identical.
#: No git tag names this commit, so ``version_is_release`` stays false in the
#: JSON beside this module: ``0.1.0`` is what the checkout's ``pyproject``
#: says, not a cut release.
#: Re-pinned 2026-09-08 to 9d2314819 (Tessera #429) for the bounded
#: canonical Hessian reader and FIFO refusal. The raw contract additionally
#: carries LFM construction output sizes; the admission answer, native
#: extensions and serving-cell table are unchanged. Native TP2 remains an
#: explicit research construction with no runtime-cell promotion.
#: Re-pinned 2026-09-08 to 07ad344c3 (Tessera #431) for the explicit
#: packed checkpoint execution declaration and strict typed export carriers.
#: Contract bytes and admission answers remain unchanged. This is a producer
#: API/source dependency, with no full-model or TP2 qualification claim.
#: Re-pinned 2026-09-09 to b1eb1dccc for the opt-in best-form encoder and
#: tile controls (#437/#438), including reviewed cached-export and rank-local
#: intake fixes (#434/#436). Actual GLM pricing preserves measured bytes and
#: scores; the unchanged contract and answer grant no new serving qualification.
#: Re-pinned 2026-09-12 to 1c827abc4 (Tessera #464, closing its #456): runtime
#: contract v23 / lane-eligibility schema v10, which turns each
#: ``lane_eligibility.platforms`` entry into an object stating its backend and
#: what it EXECUTES per family, and adds the two AMD platforms (``gfx1151``,
#: ``gfx1201``) with no cells. The ten ``sm_121`` cells are byte-identical and
