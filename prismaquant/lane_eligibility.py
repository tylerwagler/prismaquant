"""Serving-lane eligibility, ATTESTED from the pinned runtime's own contract.

Principle 14: a claim about another runtime is *derived from a machine-readable
table the pinned runtime publishes, or refused*. This module is the consumption
half of that rule. It never encodes what a serving runtime does; it reads what
that runtime *says* it does, from the packaged ``runtime_contract.json`` its
installed distribution carries, and reports ``UNATTESTED`` when the pinned
release publishes no claim covering a unit.

The live publisher is Tessera's own vLLM plugin (``tessera.serving``). Until
2026-09-02 it was the Gridbook codebook plugin, and this module was named
``gridbook_lane_eligibility``; the Gridbook lane was retired that day (Rob:
"put Tessera in PrismaQuant and remove Gridbook") and the module was renamed
to the neutral name it should always have had. See
``archive/gridbook_lane_2026-09-02/README.md``.

Why this exists (the measured defect, on the retired lane). The shipped DSv4
87 GB codebook artifact carried 11 routed FP8-CB layers whose
``gate_proj``/``up_proj`` bound distinct learned codebooks. That runtime's
persistent-B prefill lane refused per-role split books, so those layers took
the announced expand+grouped-bridge route above the token threshold. Nothing in
the producer knew: no serving-profile lane declared a structured
``route_status``, so eligibility was not a gate input and a user discovered it
at serve time. Its twin on the vanilla-vLLM lane is
``units_on_fallback_route=0`` -- vacuous, because no spec declares route status
at all, so the counter is reachable only by never having looked.

The shape of the fix is therefore as important as the values:

* Verdicts are NEVER literals in this repository. A serving-profile lane
  declares which eligibility key it consults; the verdict is resolved here from
  the pinned contract.
* Absence is LOUD and typed. When the pinned contract publishes no eligibility
  table every unit resolves to :data:`ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED`, and the
  provenance payload omits the backed/fallback counters entirely rather than
  reporting them as zero. A vacuous zero must be unrepresentable.
* Route status alone never removes an honestly priced rung from the allocator's
  menu (principle 1). It gates EXPORT, per artifact, per principle 9.

Schemas v3/v4/v5, and why absence carries the whole weight
---------------------------------------------------
``tessera.lane-eligibility.v3`` is a **closed-world cell table**. It declares
``platforms``, ``regimes``, ``structures`` and a list of ``cells``, each cell
naming exactly one ``(platform, family, structure, regime)`` and the rung set it
covers -- ``rungs`` (codebook K) for a ``cb_product`` family, ``rungs_q256``
(body bits per 256 weights) for a RATE-addressed family. Which discriminator a
cell uses is NOT a key on the cell: it is decided by whether the cell's family
appears in ``formats[]`` with a rate-addressed ``kind``
(:data:`RATE_ADDRESSED_FORMAT_KINDS`), exactly as the publisher's own
validator decides it.

``tessera.lane-eligibility.v4`` adds a required non-empty ``executes`` set of
``{symbol, decoder}`` launches and makes residency an explicit resolution
axis. A caller must name a residency; two cells in the same scope may never
claim the same residency. The published serve flag selects that axis, and the
family's ``residency_modes`` bounds it. Legacy v3 tables retain their original
resolution semantics and never acquire fabricated launch claims.

``tessera.lane-eligibility.v5`` additionally requires every cell to name its
exact image digest and execution-mode scope. Missing target context is
unattested, never a request to use the global dense image or another cell.

``tessera.lane-eligibility.v6`` requires every cell to carry ``evidence``
(a derived grade, KL receipts, a greedy smoke's status) and the vLLM/torch
versions it was measured under. ``v7`` (Tessera #195) adds the smoke's
``control`` -- the reference it was compared against -- and an
``attribution`` derived from it. ``v8`` (Tessera #198) adds
``evidence.artifact``, the encoder scope of the KL: which commit wrote the
bytes it was measured on, and whether a later encoder reproduces them.
Each is parsed closed at its own schema and refused by name where this
reader does not understand it; see :func:`parse_cell_evidence` and, for
what the reader DECIDES on, :func:`cell_evidence_admits`.

The lane predicate (contract v20, Tessera #264)
-----------------------------------------------
A cell names the LAUNCHES it executes (``executes[].decoder``); since
contract v20 the contract also publishes, per ``native_extensions[]`` row, a
``lane`` block naming the decoder that extension serves and -- for the
window-GEMV kernel -- ``requires``, the predicate a unit's WIRE must satisfy
for the kernel to read it (column rates, window bits, body, plane, no release
overrides, no diagonals, no rotation, no start state, a scalar grid).  The
loader refuses a unit that fails it, so a producer that selected such a unit
would ship bytes whose serve substitutes or refuses.  This reader parses the
predicate closed at Tessera's own vocabulary (:func:`parse_lane_claim`) and
:func:`cell_lane_admits` decides it for a cell -- by handing THIS producer's
planned wire (``tessera_render.planned_wire_facts``) to Tessera's own
decision core (``tessera.serving.scheme.decide_lane_requirements``).  The
rule has one home and it is not in this repository; what lives here is the
facts and the refusal.

One parser, and why the vocabulary is wider than one publisher
---------------------------------------------------------------
``gridbook.lane-eligibility.v3`` was the same wire format from the retired
lane, and this parser served both. What remains of that is vocabulary, not a
second authority: the ``cb_product`` kind, its ``rungs`` discriminator and the
``tcq_trellis`` rate-addressed kind are still parsed, because they are the
closed-world grammar a v3 table is written in, and a parser that silently
dropped a kind would mis-read a table rather than refuse it. Only
:data:`LANE_ELIGIBILITY_SCHEMAS` decides whose tables are accepted, and since
2026-09-02 that set names Tessera alone.

The publisher's cell status vocabulary is ``backed | backed_with_serve_flag |
fallback``. There is deliberately **no ``unbacked`` cell**: a runtime does not
enumerate what it cannot serve, so the ONLY negative signal a v3 table carries
is *absence* -- no cell names this platform, this family, this rung. This
module therefore resolves an uncovered unit to :data:`ROUTE_STATUS_UNATTESTED`
rather than inventing ``unbacked`` from silence, and the export gate fails
closed on an unattested unit whose family the contract governs. A parser that
silently admitted an unlisted rate would turn the one negative signal the table
has into no signal at all.

Scope, derived rather than typed. A unit is *in scope* when its payload family
appears in the pinned contract's ``formats[]`` table -- that is the runtime
saying "I decode these bytes", so its eligibility table is the authority for
them. BF16, a SOURCE passthrough and a stock compressed-tensors rung derive no
family, land out of scope, and are counted and reported rather than refused.
The scope test comes from the published table, never from a list typed here.

Vocabulary note. Principle 9's lane enum is
``backed | backed_with_serve_flag | unbacked``; this module uses it verbatim,
plus ``unattested`` for the no-claim state and, at *regime* granularity only,
``fallback`` for a route that serves by an announced non-native path.
``allocator_candidates.ROUTE_STATUS_*`` is a DIFFERENT and older tri-state
(``backed | pending | blocked``) describing source-passthrough contracts; the
two are deliberately not unified here -- one describes a passthrough rung's
audit state, the other a lane's executed route under the pinned release.

    Every field is a structural fact of the bytes the exporter is about to

    256 weights, ``role_split`` whether an expert stack binds more than one
    codebook across its projections, and the two shape fields the load gates.
    An eligibility cell may predicate on any of them.

    ``k`` and ``rate_q256`` are the two rung vocabularies and they are mutually

    a RATE-addressed family (``tcq_trellis`` or ``tessera_wire``) carries a
    rate. Neither is ever a rounded bpw.
    Both stay ``None`` when the pinned release publishes no such rung, so every
    rung predicate and every cell match fails closed rather than passing on a
    rate the runtime never listed.

    ``role_split`` is the fact the DSv4 defect turned on and the one no

    """Whether a cell's own published evidence lets this producer use it.

    ONE predicate, read by both admission legs -- the development menu
    (``tessera_render.tessera_attesting_cells``) and the per-artifact export
    gate (``resolve_unit_route``) -- because a rung the menu offers and the
    export refuses, or the reverse, is the split-brain principle 8 exists to
    stop.

    What it refuses is a MEASURED serving defect, not a structure: a cell
    whose greedy smoke the runtime recorded as degenerate
    (:data:`EVIDENCE_SMOKE_REFUSALS`) fails principle 9's "generates correctly"
    leg, and it fails it in a structured field rather than in prose. Nothing
    here mentions ``routed_moe``: a hardcoded structure ban would be principle
    1's vetoed band-aid, and a cell this refuses is refused for what was
    measured on it, not for what it is. The answer therefore tracks whatever
    status the PINNED table publishes and nothing else -- the two routed-MoE
    cells were refused from contract v17 through v20 on ``repetitive`` and are
    not refused at v21, which publishes ``recorded``, with no edit here either
    time. Whether that ``recorded`` is CHECKABLE is a different question and
    not this predicate's: RobTand/tessera#327 found that v21's rule lived only
    in a dated measurements file and was satisfiable by an empty completion,
    which lane schema v9 answers by putting the rule and its rows in
    ``smoke.record`` -- re-derived at parse through Tessera's own
    ``derive_smoke_status`` (:func:`_parse_smoke_record`), so a status this
    predicate reads is one a reader could check. Whether routed-MoE Tessera is
    PROMOTED past the menu remains a human's call (prismaquant #198).

    What it deliberately does NOT refuse is a low GRADE. Every cell in the
    installed table is ``route_only`` or ``kl_lower_bound`` -- the publisher's
    changelog records that every served KL in that repository is a top-K
    intersection lower bound -- so a grade gate would refuse the whole lane,
    including rungs this producer already ships. Raising the grade bar is a
    promotion-ladder move and belongs to a human; the grade travels into
    provenance so a shipcard says which grade attested each unit.

    What it deliberately does NOT decide on is the v7 ATTRIBUTION.
    Tessera's contract v18 changelog states the consumer rule it expects --
    "a gate that refused on status alone now refuses on status 'repetitive'
    AND attribution other than 'shared_with_reference'" -- and on the v20
    table that rule admitted both routed-MoE cells, whose control showed the
    BF16 source returning the same degenerate completion. This reader refuses
    on the status: ``shared_with_reference`` removes the evidence AGAINST the
    route without adding any FOR it, and admitting a structure this producer
    has never shipped on that basis is a promotion, which is a human's call.
    The refusal names the control so the reviewer sees what was read and not
    decided on; prismaquant #198 holds the decision. v21 retired the control
    from those cells, so the branch is exercised on the v20 shape in
    ``tests/test_tessera_lane_v8.py`` rather than on an installed cell.

    A pre-v6 cell carries no evidence block and is admitted unchanged: the
    grammar that never published the field cannot be read as publishing a
    failure.
