"""Production-faithful rendered-weight cache for measured candidates.

Per-Linear candidate probes and real-KL gates need to measure the same
rendered weights that export will ship. Without this cache the perturbation
installed into the model is bare RTN. The export pipeline renders weights with
several activation-aware passes; the shipped δw is much smaller than the RTN
δw at the same format.

This module pre-renders `W_tilde[name, fmt]` once, using the production
quantization path:

  IMPLEMENTED (v1):
    * scalar GPTQ (with damp sweep when env-enabled)
    * optional scalar scale-sweep
    * joint NVFP4 fused-sibling globals (q/k/v share a per-tensor scale,
      gate/up share theirs)
    * calibrated `input_global_scale` per fused-sibling group
      (max_abs(activations) / 6.0; the same value the export persists
      to the artifact)
    * progressive local render gates using the shared mechanism order
      baseline -> format scale rule -> GPTQ -> optional scale_sweep;
      individual formats explicitly opt out of unsupported mechanisms,
      and regressive candidates fall back to the previous accepted render
      while recording metadata
    * FP8_DYNAMIC/FP8_E4M3 per-row scale search when scale_sweep is enabled;
      explicit MXFP8 E8M0 scale search remains opt-in. These refine the current
      accepted render rather than starting a separate format-specific path
    * activation-weighted GPTQ for FP8_DYNAMIC/FP8_E4M3. Explicit MXFP8 keeps
      GPTQ support for research/legacy artifacts. NVFP4 is the only production
      format that uses joint_scale_opt; MXFP8 uses the canonical E8M0 scale rule.
    * retired Fisher-weighted local objectives are archived under
      ``archive/fisher_2026-05-15/`` and are not part of the production
      pipeline
    * retired input-axis rotation experiments are not part of the production
      cache path.

  KNOWN GAPS (v2 work, NOT implemented):
    * batched NVFP4 GPTQ + scale-sweep across same-shape Linears
      (defaults-on in the export when activations are cached;
      mathematically equivalent to scalar but ~3-8× faster on MoE)
    * block-output match (post-GPTQ refinement against BF16 block output)
    * any export-only refinements added after this docstring is written

  FP8_DYNAMIC / BF16:
    * FP8_DYNAMIC is represented by the canonical FP8_E4M3 format name:
      per-output-row FP32 weight scales and per-token dynamic activation
      scales. It uses GPTQ damp-sweep by default in production render.
    * Explicit MXFP8/MXFP4 formats remain available only when requested.
    * BF16 is passthrough.

PerturbedActivationCache installs `W_tilde` (and applies the calibrated
`input_global_scale` on activations) instead of RTN-quantizing on the
fly, so per-Linear probes, frontier validation, and polish gates use the
same δw the export will deliver, modulo the v2 gaps above.

Usage:

    cache = fill_production_weight_cache(
        model, calib_ids, qnames=qnames, formats=["NVFP4"],
    )
    cache.validate_coverage(qnames, ["NVFP4"])  # raise on misses
    perturbed_cache = PerturbedActivationCache(
        ..., production_weight_cache=cache,
    )

# Formats whose WEIGHT PLANE is the same artifact and must therefore get the
# same production render.
#
# NVFP4 and NVFP4A16 are one serialization: identical packed 4-bit weights,
# identical group scales, identical per-tensor global scale. They differ only in
# whether the config group declares `input_activations`, which vLLM reads to
# pick W4A4 (CUTLASS) or W4A16 (Marlin) at RUNTIME. The bytes on disk are the
# same bytes.
#
# The render gate used to be `fmt == "NVFP4"` literally, so NVFP4A16 fell
# through to the registry RTN path and shipped weights that had never seen
# GPTQ, static_act_order or JSO -- measured max|diff| 0.0217 against NVFP4 on a
# 512x1024 Linear. That made A16 strictly WORSE on the weight plane, so any
# A16-vs-A4 comparison measured the rendering difference rather than the
# activation contract: a rendering confound, principle 8's exact prohibition,
# and it silently biased the allocator against ever choosing A16.
#
# GPTQ's objective is ||WX - W_hat X|| under the CALIBRATION activations, which
# are the true unquantized ones in both contracts. Nothing in the weight solve
# depends on whether activations are quantized at serve time, so the same
# render is not merely acceptable for both -- it is the correct one, and
# sharing it makes the activation axis genuinely byte-free AND render-free.
# That is what lets one production cache entry serve both contracts.

    """Compute the production-faithful dequantized weight for ``(qname, fmt)``.

    Returns a tensor matching ``weight.shape`` and dtype.  For NVFP4 this
    runs GPTQ + scale_sweep (the activation-aware passes) with the joint
    fused-sibling NVFP4 global if supplied; for BF16 and RTN-only formats
    it falls back to the registry quantize_dequantize because those formats
    don't benefit from activation-aware refinement in the production pipeline.

    ``joint_global_real`` is the max-across-fused-siblings NVFP4 global
    used to keep q/k/v (or gate/up) per-tensor scales unified — same as
    the export's ``_compute_nvfp4_joint_global``.  When ``None`` the
    per-Linear computed value is used (legacy behavior, only correct for
    isolated Linears with no fused siblings).

    ``act_clip_threshold`` is an optional scalar clamp for activation-aware
    render passes. ``fisher_row_weights`` optionally weights local objectives
    by per-token gradient² from h-detail.

    ``col_weights`` is the per-input-column imatrix vector (``(in_features,)``)
    for this ``qname`` — CB **Milestone C** / re-vet **R3**. It is applied for
    the weighted-render families ONLY (``WEIGHTED_RENDER_FAMILIES``: the CB
    codebook families and GGUF), whose exporters ship imatrix-weighted bytes;
    for every other format the argument is inert and the render is
    **bit-identical** whether it is passed or not (pinned by
    ``tests/test_col_weights_render_identity.py``). The vector is supplied by
    the caller rather than derived here from ``activations`` on purpose: the
    exporter's vector is the harvested ``artifacts/cb_col_weights.pkl``, which
    includes the synthesized packed-expert entries
    (``moe_imatrix.synthesize_packed_expert_col_weights``) that no raw
    activation matrix on this path can reproduce. With it, the CB lane's cost,
    KL and shipped bytes can come from ONE render through
    ``ProductionWeightCache``.

    ``ldlq_missing_activation_ok`` is a deliberately narrow cold-expert
    escape hatch.  It may be set only by a caller that has already checked an
    exact never-routed provenance declaration.  In that case the exporter
    itself fail-closes LDLQ to the raw, imatrix-weighted render, so returning
    that same render is production-faithful.  The default remains fail-closed
    for an ordinary missing activation row.

    ``"qname|FMT"`` entry records the ``calibration_data_hash`` of the fit
    corpus its bytes were fitted on. A section-level bind was tried for
    #170 and reverted — it refused the sanctioned M4 lazy gap-fill, which
    legitimately renders a disjoint split of the cache under the
    render-split calibration. Per-pair binding lets that split record its
    own entries: disjoint pairs merge, while the same pair under a
    different hash refuses (existing shards are never re-rendered, so the
    recorded hash is always the bytes on disk). Pipeline builds pass one
    calib to the fill and all its appends, so the base identity's
    ``calib_hash`` still covers that path, and CB pairs bind their own fit
    hash per pair.

    Args:
      model: live HF model on the export device.
      calib_ids: ``[N, T]`` token id tensor for activation collection.
      qnames: which Linears are eligible to render (skips MoE packed
        experts; handle those separately via `_quantize_3d_packed`
        extensions). This is also the set the activation collector HOOKS,
        and the rendered bytes are a function of it: pass the whole
        enumeration and narrow with `render_assignment`/`render_qnames`, never
        by shortening this list (#130).
      formats: which formats to pre-render when `render_assignment` is not
        supplied.
      render_assignment: optional concrete export assignment. When supplied,
        render exactly the non-BF16 `(qname, fmt)` entries used by that
        assignment instead of the full `qnames x formats` menu.
      render_qnames: optional render-only narrowing, orthogonal to
        `render_assignment`. Render just these qnames (a stripe, a shard) while
        still hooking all of `qnames`, so the shard's bytes are the whole
        run's bytes. `None` renders everything in scope.
      levers: which production levers to enable (default: GPTQ with optional
        joint NVFP4 scale optimization when requested by the caller).
      recache_pass: when True, run a second calibration forward with the
        concrete production assignment installed from this cache and refit
        ``activation_max_abs`` under quantized upstream weights.
      recache_assignment: required when ``recache_pass`` is True.  Candidate
        caches with multiple possible formats per Linear are ambiguous; recache
        needs the actual export assignment.
      h_detail_dir: optional probe h-detail directory retained for archived
        Fisher ablations. V1 production defaults do not require it.
      col_weights: optional ``{qname: (in_features,)}`` imatrix map (re-vet R3
        / CB Milestone C). Applied only to the weighted-render families
        (``WEIGHTED_RENDER_FAMILIES``); every other format's rendered bytes are
        bit-identical whether it is supplied or not. This is what lets the CB
        lane's allocator cost, frontier KL and shipped bytes all come from ONE
        ``ProductionWeightCache`` render instead of a separate
        skeleton-requantize path.
      cb_serialization_context: explicit artifact serialization identity for
        every CB render. Required when the scope contains a CB format; never
        inferred from the current environment.

class _PackedExpertActivationCollector:
    """Capture module-level input ``X`` for each packed-experts module.

    Packed 3-D MoE experts are not ``nn.Linear`` and so are invisible to
    ``_LinearActivationCollector``.  This collector hooks the experts module
    itself and reservoir-samples its module-level input (the pre-routing token
    hidden states ``[*, hidden]``).  At render time the captured ``X`` is split
    into per-expert routed rows by ``derive_per_expert_activations`` — the same
    routing the live forward used — so each expert's GPTQ Hessian sees exactly
    the rows that route to it.

    The per-module token budget (``module_token_budget``) is intentionally much
    larger than the per-Linear ``max_rows`` budget: with top-k routing over E
    experts each expert only sees ~``top_k/E`` of the tokens, so a stable
    per-expert Hessian needs ``~max_rows_per_expert * E / top_k`` module tokens.

    An optional ``row_consumer(qname, X)`` observes each full, live input before
    storage selection. It must consume synchronously rather than retain X;
    campaigns use it to accumulate full-calibration Hessians without creating
    a second module-input cache. An optional boundary_consumer receives the
    original module, positional and keyword arguments before row selection or
    dtype conversion, preserving actual routing tensors for native validation.
    The default leaves reservoir sampling intact.

    the same-domain holdout. Default ``None`` preserves prior behavior.

    This closes the packed-expert RTN-by-omission gap: every non-BF16 packed
    expert tensor receives a deliberate cache render keyed by routed
    per-expert activations. In production's default ``"batched"`` mode that
    render is fixed-damp batched GPTQ without dense JSO/act-order/damp-sweep,
    followed by the measured GPTQ-vs-RTN gate below. The non-default
    ``"per_expert"`` mode is the one that calls ``render_production_weight``
    and matches the dense GPTQ+damp-sweep+JSO stack. Export then reads the
    cached 3-D dequant and re-packs it — exactly the
    ``_pack_production_cached_2d`` contract, lifted to packed experts.

    Hook invariant (#145, mirrors the dense #130/#135 one): the activation
    collector hooks EVERY packed-experts module this call can see
    (``eligible_experts_qnames``), and ``render_assignment``/``force_format`` narrow
    only which tensors get rendered. The bytes of a packed (tensor, fmt)
    pair are therefore a function of the visible modules and the
    calibration, never of which subset a call renders — a ``force_format``
    frontier build and an assignment-scoped export build that BF16s one
    layer's experts render identical bytes for the rest.

    Args:
      cache: the ``ProductionWeightCache`` produced by
        ``fill_production_weight_cache``.  New 3-D ``(experts_qname.pn, fmt)``
        entries are added in place (and streamed to ``cache_dir`` shards when
        disk-streaming is on).
      render_assignment: the concrete export assignment (recipe_key -> fmt).
        Only non-BF16 packed-expert tensors are rendered (BF16 = passthrough).
      levers: the resolved production lever dict. It is consumed by
        ``render_mode="per_expert"``; the production ``"batched"`` path uses
        its fixed fast recipe regardless of dense-linears JSO/damp-sweep
        levers.
      module_token_budget: reservoir size for each experts module's input X.
      max_rows_per_expert: cap on routed rows fed to each expert's GPTQ.
      max_layers: debug/timing cap — render only the first N experts modules.
      col_weights: optional ``{qname: vector}`` imatrix map (re-vet R3 / CB
        Milestone C), keyed by the packed tensor name (``…experts.w1`` etc.)
        with either one shared ``(in_features,)`` vector or a per-expert
        ``(E, in_features)`` stack — the layout
        ``moe_imatrix.synthesize_packed_expert_col_weights`` emits. Applied
        only on the per-expert render path and only for the weighted-render
        families; NVFP4/FP8 expert bytes are unchanged.
      cb_serialization_context: explicit artifact serialization identity for
        CB expert renders. Required for CB and never inferred from process
        environment defaults.
      module_acts_override: streaming build. ``{experts_qname: X}`` module-level
        input snapshots sourced from the probe's activation cache instead of a
        fresh forward pass. When supplied, no calibration forward runs, in-scope
        experts are restricted to the supplied modules (the currently-installed
        decoder layer), ``calib_ids`` may be ``None``, and the cross-domain gate
        corpus is unsupported.

    Returns a coverage dict consumed by the export enforcement gate:
      ``{experts_qname.pn: {"fmt", "n_experts", "min_rows", "median_rows",
      "rendered", "had_activations"}}``.
