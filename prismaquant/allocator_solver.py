    This opt-in alternative to :func:`solve_allocation` charges exact integer
    ``Candidate.memory_bytes`` and preserves nondominance, including nonconvex
    pockets and faster same-byte activation routes with higher loss. Decode
    joins the frontier only when constrained. A device budget adds THREE
    independent coordinates: summed terminal residency, maximum scratch, and
    maximum activation bytes. Comparing their current sum would discard valid
    options because later operators can replace one of those maxima.

    Candidate rows must already represent independent serving units with all
    legal group options retained. A group option is atomic: its runtime row
    must measure that whole operator. There is no leaf-latency summation,
    serving promotion, quality rescaling, byte binning or convex-hull pruning.
    The caller validates timing provenance/workload/group bindings, charges
    non-additive artifact costs and fixed runtime overhead, and runs final
    end-to-end validation. Resource sums propose assignments; they do not
    certify TTFT/decode quantiles.

    All input prices are checked before search, including infeasible rows.
    Missing constrained decode prices refuse. Units and formats are traversed
    lexically; equal active-coordinate vectors retain the lexically first
    assignment. Results sort by quality, then active resources, then formats.
    Comparisons use the supplied finite numeric values without epsilons.

    Intermediate folds include canonical assignment order as a dominance
    coordinate: a later peak can erase a strict resource difference, and a
    floating-point sum can erase a strict loss difference. Retaining the
    lexically earlier prefix preserves the final tie rule in those cases.
    This auxiliary coordinate is removed for the final resource frontier.

    ``max_states`` bounds each fold frontier (including that tie coordinate);
    ``max_transitions`` bounds the total attempted cross-product pairs before
    budget/dominance filtering. Crossing either finite bound raises
    :class:`RuntimeFrontierLimitError`, with ``complete=False`` diagnostics;
    it never returns a truncated or approximate frontier. An empty returned

    """Solve, promote coupled tensors, and retry if promotion exceeds budget.

    Termination contract: the returned
    assignment is always FEASIBLE — ``achieved <= target_bits +
    overshoot_tolerance`` — and, among the feasible iterates seen, the
    one with MINIMUM total predicted Δloss (ties broken toward larger
    achieved bits). Δloss is the solver's actual objective; density is
    not a proxy for it — more bits is not monotonically better (5.5 bpp
    has beaten 6.0 bpp on served PPL), and promotion can flip a serving
    group into a denser-but-worse format. When no
    iterate is feasible within ``max_iters`` the rung is INFEASIBLE and
    ``(None, nan)`` is returned so callers exclude it from the Pareto curve
    and byte-budget bisection. Three silent fallbacks are replaced:

      - ``solve_allocation`` returning None (tightened below the format
        floor) used to return the previous, massively over-target iterate;
      - any undershoot, however deep, used to be accepted immediately
        (rung 6.0 returning achieved 4.95 with 25x worse loss);
      - the stall exit used to return an iterate still far above target.

    Honest scope: only the ``--target-bits`` emit path shipped those
    over-target iterates silently. The byte-budget selector priced them
    at their true (larger) disk size, so its feasibility calls were
    correct — the rung label was just wrong, skewing the Pareto curve's
    x-axis rather than fabricating feasibility.

    First evaluate the per-unit minimum measured loss assignment. Return it
    if serving promotion preserves every unit's minimum and its unrounded
    candidate payload fits. Otherwise use the existing two-phase search on
    the *tightened* DP target. The caller still exact-prices shared sidecars
    and other non-additive artifact costs before accepting any proposal.

    The binned search runs in two phases:

    1. Damped descent (the old loop's cost profile — the first eval at the
       full target is the only expensive DP; every subsequent eval has a
       smaller bin table): tighten by ``overshoot/2`` until an iterate is
       feasible or the DP floor is reached.
    2. Bracket bisection between the first feasible tightened value and the
       last infeasible one, ratcheting the minimum-Δloss feasible
       assignment.
       Promotion is a coarse step function (one packed-MoE serving group
       flipping format moves the average by tenths of a bit), so
       achieved(tightened) is locally non-monotone; the ratchet keeps
       correctness anyway, and infeasibility is only declared when the
       whole bracket is exhausted with no feasible iterate.

    ``stall_threshold`` is reused as the plateau epsilon for the descent
    acceleration; ``stall_grace`` is retained for call compatibility but
    unused (both phases shrink their search state every evaluation, so
    they cannot stall).

    Pass ``diagnostics`` (an empty dict) to receive the numbers an INFEASIBLE
    verdict needs to be actionable — they are otherwise computed and thrown
    away. The dict is filled IN PLACE, on every return path:

      ``target_bits``, ``min_bits`` (the DP baseline: cheapest-candidate
      average bits, i.e. the format floor), ``overshoot_tolerance``,
      ``evals``, ``feasible``, ``achieved_bits`` / ``predicted_dloss`` (the
      returned iterate, ``None`` when INFEASIBLE), ``closest_achieved_bits``
      / ``closest_tightened_target`` (the least-overshooting iterate seen —
      "how close did it get"), and ``floor_achieved_bits`` (what the DP floor
      itself promoted to, the number that distinguishes "target below the
      format floor" from "serving-group promotion overshoots").
