"""Per-row repricing for recorded allocator selections.

The allocator prices a raw ``(Linear, format)`` cost row through
``allocator_candidates.cost_entry_predicted_dloss``.  That precedence is
load-bearing: measured ``output_mse`` already includes the activation path,
whereas a weight-only row receives P5a's per-family multiplicative correction.
Aggregated serving-unit rows carry ``activation_pricing_applied=True`` because
their member prices already contain that correction; applying it again is the
historical double-counting bug this module exists to prevent.

This module deliberately does not aggregate, collapse, or promote an
assignment.  It reconstructs the price of exactly the layer-config rows it is
given, which makes it suitable both for reconciliation and for research tools
that need per-expert counterfactual prices.
