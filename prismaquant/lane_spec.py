"""`LaneSpec` — one lane-uniform ship gate across native / CB / GGUF.

Re-vet **R16** (`docs/audits/architecture_re-vet_2026-07-30.md`), which closes
the measurement half of debt **D26**.

**The asymmetry was wiring, not capability.** `validate_quantized_model.py` is
already runtime-agnostic — it drives an OpenAI-compatible endpoint over HTTP
(`--base-url`, `--model-name`) and knows nothing about compressed-tensors;
`grep 'gguf\\|nvfp4_cb'` across every `validate_*.py` returns zero hits. What
was missing is a *declaration* of what each lane's serve command, endpoint,
gate set and KL evaluator are, so "the bar" is defined once instead of being
native's bar by default and nothing elsewhere.

Same idiom as `serving_profile_specs/`: JSON declarations plus a dataclass with
`from_dict`, so a new lane is a data file rather than a branch.

**Gates are ADVISORY *to the build run*, and BLOCKING at publication.**
Nothing in this module fails a pipeline run — `LaneSpec.advisory_gates` is
`True` for every lane and a test pins it, so a future flip is a deliberate
edit rather than a drift. What makes a gate more than a printed sentence is
its `shipcard_slot`: the build lane OPENS the slot, the serve lane FILLS it,
and `tools/publish_artifact.py` refuses an artifact whose slots are not
closed. Whether gates should also fail the *run* is R16's open half, deferred
to Robert.

**So a gate with no slot is enforced by nothing**, and until 2026-09-03 that
was indistinguishable from a gate someone had simply not filled in.
`LaneGate.from_dict` now refuses a null `shipcard_slot` that carries no
`unrecorded_reason`, and `LaneSpec.wired_architectures` / `producer_tools` put
the lane's architecture roster and its external build-tool dependencies in the
same declaration instead of in a test constant and a bash loop. The chain a
reader should be able to follow is: gate declared here -> slot opened by
`prismaquant.lane_shipcard` in the lane's driver arm -> refused by
`publish_artifact`. Where any link is missing, the gate is a confession log
(RobTand/prismaquant#119, principle 9).

    The format registry declares NVFP4 a W4A4 format. That is a fact about the

    a BF16 GEMM -- what its own docstring calls "the exact native BF16 bridge"
    -- unless a fused activation mode is explicitly selected by a
    process-global env selector. Every gate and gold serve on the nvfp4_cb lane
    leaves those selectors unset, so an NVFP4_CB unit's activations are never
    quantized there and its A-side cost is exactly zero.

    Pricing an A-side the runtime does not execute is a CURRENCY error, not a
    conservative overestimate. It makes a format look more expensive than it
    is, and the DP then spends real weight bytes escaping a cost of zero: on
    DSv4-Flash at 87.403 GB it promoted 2,307 units to FP8_CB and funded that
    by dropping the bulk of the model from codebook rung K16 to K12 (four fewer
    index bits on ~19k units). Discovered 2026-08-17; the same mispricing is on
    the Qwen3.8-27B CB-A allocation, which used `cost_aura_anchored_aqua.pkl`
    while serving with the same selectors unset.

    ``executes`` is the authority the A-side pricing must intersect with. It is
    a set of **glob patterns** over format names, because the answer is per
    FAMILY and the rungs within a family are open-ended: the CB lane bridges
    every ``NVFP4_CB_K*`` but genuinely serves every ``FP8_CB_K*`` as W8A8
    (`gridbook/linear.py` feeds quantized ``xq`` with per-token dynamic scales
    into ``native_cutlass_scaled_mm``; `moe.py` declares
    ``_FP8_GROUPED_CONTRACT = "fp8_per_token_dynamic"``). Listing rungs
    explicitly would silently under-declare the day a new one is added, which
