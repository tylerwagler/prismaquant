"""The producer's packed-source -> serving-unit projection, carried by PrismaQuant.

PrismaQuant prices routed experts as per-expert 2-D units or packed decisions
estimated from sampled experts. The source units
(``model.layers.N.feed_forward.experts.<i>.w1``) follow the model profile's
declared packed split (``lfm2_moe.json`` ``projection_splits``). Tessera, the
producer, executes those units as ONE stack per MoE block (``<block>.experts``),
and publishes exactly which source tensor, which expert, which role and which
geometry each executed unit is through ``experiments/tessera_producer_plan.py``
(schema ``tessera.expert_projection.v1``, ``tessera.serving_parts.source_identity``
for the checkpoint binding).

This module is the ONE place PrismaQuant reads that projection.  It does not
derive structure from tensor names outside the owning profile, and it never
slices a packed source tensor itself: a unit the producer projects as anything
but a whole unpacked per-expert source tensor is refused by name, because
executing ``first_half``/``second_half``/``transpose`` selectors here would be a
second home for ``export_tessera_serving.packed_expert_weight``.  Where the
producer cannot attest a unit (a layout it does not project, a stack it did not
plan) PrismaQuant refuses that unit by name rather than guessing a slice
(AGENTS.md: refuse where bytes are decided; one rule, one home).

What flows through here, in order:

* the campaign asks the producer for the projection of every in-scope stack
  (:func:`request_expert_projection`), binds it to the profile-declared units
  (:func:`bind_expert_projection`) and prices each executed unit under the
  producer's own ``unit_input_identity`` receipt;
* the allocator carries the projection block and the priced-wire receipts of
  the selected rungs into ``__prismaquant__`` unchanged;
* the export lane re-binds every selected routed unit to that projection
  (:func:`require_stack_uniform_assignment`, :func:`verify_expert_wire_record`)
  and writes the producer's ``tessera.cached_units.v1`` manifest
  (:func:`cached_units_manifest`) so the exporter packs the priced bytes
  unchanged (``--cached-expert-units``): priced == written.
