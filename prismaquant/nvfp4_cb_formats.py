"""NVFP4-CB / FP8-CB vector-quantization codebook formats (emulation).

A codeword is a d=8 vector of grid values (E2M1 for the ``fp4`` family, E4M3
for the ``fp8`` family). A k-bit index per 8 weights gives ``k/8`` index bpw;
the fp4 family adds NVFP4-identical group-16 E4M3 scales (+0.5 bpw), the fp8
family a per-output-channel fp32 scale (negligible bpw). A decoded fp4 tile is
bit-compatible NVFP4 by construction (grid values on the E2M1 grid, NVFP4 group
scale), so it feeds the CUTLASS FP4 path unchanged.

This module is Milestone A: emulation only. One weighted-VQ field quantizer
feeds the emulation ``reconstruct`` (what cost measurement scores); the byte
packer and exporter land in Milestone B and must share this exact math path.

Three VQ modes:

* ``full`` — one ``2^k`` codebook over the 8-dim vector, exhaustive weighted
  argmin (chunked). Only feasible for k<=14; raises above without an explicit
  codebook.
* ``product`` (default) — the 8-dim vector splits into two 4-dim halves, each
  with its own ``2^(k/2)`` sub-codebook (ceil/floor bit split for odd k). The
  public NVFP4-CB ladder is k=1..25. Direct low-level research can exercise
  wider codewords through k=32, but those values have no registry or export id.
* ``signed`` — DELETED 2026-08-17. Sign-magnitude factorization (the
  IQ-family move) was a real serialized mode until then, but Gridbook's native
  FP4 path is written against the UNSIGNED two-tier product layout
  (``n_sub=2, type_size=4*k+9``) and has no quality-preserving prefill kernel
  for ``n_sub=1``, so a signed rung could only ever ride a fallback route. It
  had also lost 78.48% of matched weight-MSE comparisons. The historical
  rationale, for the record: 8 explicit sign bits + an ``m = k-8``-bit index
  into a MAGNITUDE codebook over the positive half-grid, because a flat
  codebook burns most of its entries covering sign patterns (~2^8 per
  magnitude shape at d=8); factoring the signs out spent all 2^m entries on
  magnitude shapes (exp-1 diagnosis: this is why IQ2_S beat flat CB +66% at
  matched bytes). Encode is exactly separable under weighted L2 (see
  ``_fields_block``); tables are tiny (m=5..8 -> 32..256 entries).

The weighted objective is llama.cpp/imatrix style:
``sum_j w_j (x_j - c_j)^2`` per codeword, with per-input-column ``col_weights``
(the same plumbing as the GGUF lane).

Scale search: CB encode sweeps the per-group (fp4) / per-row (fp8) scale over a
grid of E4M3-legal candidates and picks the one minimizing weighted
reconstruction error in the ORIGINAL weight domain, then refines with 2
WLS-refit fixed-point iterations — rendering parity with the IQ lane's
27-candidate ``_grid_fields`` sweep. ``scale_sweep=True`` is the default for all
three modes and both grids. The amax/6 (fp4) / amax/448 (fp8) one-shot scale is
always in the candidate set, so the sweep is never worse than one-shot. **The
Phase-0 exp-1 0.6B results (pre-c3f8c6d) used one-shot scales for CB while the
IQ arms got their scale sweep — that rendering asymmetry is corrected here;
re-run before trusting any CB-vs-IQ delta.**

Scale coding (fp4 family): the v1 plane stores each group-16 scale as a bare
E4M3 byte — on real LLM weights ~90% of group scales sit in e4m3's SUBNORMAL
band, where the sweep's candidates collapse to ~1-2 distinct values
(two-tier-scale-spec.md §3). Layout v2 ("two_tier", opt-in until the serving
gates clear) stores a per-superblock E8M0 super `2^(E-127)` plus 16 4-bit sub
codes into an e4m3-exact multiplier table; the composition IS an E4M3 scale by
construction, the encoder explores every reachable value across the ideal-scale
window (~20+ distinct candidates where v1 had 1-2), and the scale plane shrinks
16 B -> 9 B per superblock (0.5 -> 0.28125 bpw). Every fp4 exp-1/1b number was
measured under v1 coding.

# as err(s) = C - 2s*B + s^2*A with per-(vector, entry) moments A, B that do
# NOT depend on the scale (the _grid_fields/_sweep_errs identity), so all
# candidates score from moments built ONCE per chunk instead of recomputing
# a full VQ distance matrix per candidate. C is constant per vector across
# candidates and cancels in every argmin, so it is dropped. The selection
# matches the exact sweep up to fp-rounding ties; refits and the final
# assignment stay on the exact direct-eval path.

# --- Row-periodic A ---------------------------------------------------------
# A = sum_j w_j t_j^2 depends only on the COLUMN weights, and the production
# imatrix is one per-input-column vector broadcast over rows. wq therefore
# repeats every ``in_f // VEC_DIM`` vectors, so A repeats too: the (m, K)
# moment is ``m / P`` identical copies of a (P, K) base. Keeping only the base
# removes half the moment build and half the bytes every scoring pass has to
# stream (the scan is bandwidth-bound on exactly these two planes), and the
# base is small enough to stay resident in L2. Values are untouched — each
# output element is the same length-``sub_dim`` dot product — so every emitted
# byte is unchanged.
