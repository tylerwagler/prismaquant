    """One native source format the producer can ship back UNCHANGED.

    Keeping a native source format always preserves its stored weight plane;
    it is an allocator option only when the serving activation contract is
    also priced honestly. This table records the source/storage contract, one
    entry per
    (source format, unit contract) the census finds, so adding a newly
    encountered native format is a data change rather than a new code path.

    Fields:
      ``source_kind``  the token ``_scan_source_dtype_manifest`` stamps on a
        unit whose stored bytes ARE this format. It is the whole legality
        gate: the format is legal exactly where the source already is it, in
        both directions — BF16 is masked on mxfp4 experts and MXFP4_SOURCE is
        masked on the bf16 embedding by the identical rule.
      ``zero_cost_by_construction`` whether the allocator SYNTHESIZES the
        candidate rather than requiring a cost-table column. True for formats
        no cost run will ever have a column for.
      ``serving_route``  the P5b lane route id.
      ``wire_format_id``  the closed-enum spelling the artifact declares and
        the serving side reads (quant_config.json ``source_passthrough``).
        Distinct from ``format_name``: the producer's registry name is ours to
        rename, the wire id is a cross-repo contract.
      ``route_status``  what a MEASUREMENT says about serving these bytes, per
        ``ROUTE_STATUS_*``. Route status alone never removes an honestly
        priced rung from the menu — an allocator that wants an unservable
        passthrough is reporting a serving gap — but anything other than
        ``backed`` makes export fail closed without an explicit override.
        This is orthogonal to cost admission: a terminal whose activation-side
        loss has no currency must stay out of that allocator campaign even if
        the serving route itself exists.
      ``route_requirement``  the serving-side condition that makes a BACKED
        route actually fire (e.g. a non-default vLLM MoE backend). Belongs in
        the artifact's serving notes; a backed route with an unmet
        requirement serves no better than a blocked one.
      ``route_evidence``  what was measured, and on what hardware. A route
        verdict without its evidence is a rumour.
      ``detail``  why this entry exists, for the mask/provenance records.

        — circular. It stays out.
      * *"Is this ``output_mse`` the best price available for this row?"*
        decides which branch prices it. Here the answer for a band-interpolated
        row is yes: its value is the tensor's OWN holdout-gated interpolation
        in output space, while the alternative is its weight_mse scaled by a
        family-wide geometric-mean constant. The row's own output-space number
        beats a family aggregate — and, decisively, mixing the two bases
        WITHIN one family reorders that family's rungs, which is the failure
        ``activation_fair_pricing``'s design explicitly ruled out and which
        shipped anyway (see that module's 2026-08-07 correction: NVFP4-CB
        K13/K14/K17 priced 12x high on down_proj and 1.6x low on gate/up_proj,
        because the family constant 112.5 spans a per-projection ratio range
        of 9.4-320).

    Nothing about the row's own claims changes: ``cost_source`` and

    ``BRANCH_MEASURED``, and ``cost_entry_is_band_interpolated`` /
    ``drop_interpolated_candidates_dominated_by_measured`` keep full strength
    as the provenance and noise-band guards. Only the number's USE changes.

    Not gated on ``act_quant_changes_input``: the measured branch is not
    gated either, and gating this one would re-create exactly the same
    measured/weight-only basis mix inside an identity-activation family (at
    penalty 1.0, but weight-space vs output-space all the same). No such row
    exists today — only the two CB-ladder sites stamp ``band_interpolated``,
    and every format of ``nvfp4_cb`` and ``fp8_cb`` quantizes activations — so

    — e.g. MXFP8 over an FP8 128-block source, or MXFP4/MXFP8 over
    an MXFP4-packed QAT source. But W' == W only silences the WEIGHT side.
    For W·A· formats (``FormatSpec.act_quant_changes_input`` — NVFP4,

    source, an MXFP4 re-encode priced from weight_mse alone would cost
    dloss 0.0, the unbeatable global minimum at any budget, while its

    WHY THIS IS ADDED, NOT MULTIPLIED, AND ONLY HERE
    ------------------------------------------------
    Choosing NVFP4 commits the Linear's ACTIVATIONS to 4 bits as well as its
    weights; choosing FP8 commits them to 8; BF16 leaves them alone. A
    weight-only surrogate cannot see any of that -- NVFP4 and NVFP4A16 render
    weights BIT-IDENTICALLY (T1) -- so the DP was pricing a W4A4 format as if it
    were weight-only and systematically over-buying 4-bit.

    The term is a diagonal activation Δloss approximation derived from the
    layer's own activation statistics and is added to the weight estimate.
    A shared Δloss label does not establish equivalence to AURA's KL-adjoint
    currency or capture weight/activation cross terms (PrismaQuant #237).
    It is deliberately not a multiplicative penalty:
    ``ActivationFairPricing`` (P5a) is the multiplicative, per-FAMILY, fitted
    transfer of a weight-space number onto the measured output scale, and this
    is a per-UNIT, mechanistic, already-output-space quantity. The current
    weight-only branches add this term before applying the family penalty.

    It is added ONLY on the weight-only branches. The ``_prices_from_output_mse``
    branch is already activation-inclusive by construction (the row's own
    output-space measurement saw the activation path), and adding here would
    double-count it. ``cost_entry_is_exact_by_construction`` returns 0.0 for a
    row whose activation path is an identity, so there is nothing to add there
    either; a lossless re-encode whose SERVED activations are 4-bit is excluded
    from the menu by ``cost_entry_prices_unmeasured_activation_at_zero`` rather
    than priced at all.

    Defaults to 0.0 rather than raising because every cost artifact written
    before AQUA lacks the key, and those runs must remain bit-for-bit
    reproducible. An unmeasured A-side on an activation-quantizing format is a
    HOLE, not a zero, and is reported as such by the writer -- it is not this
    function's job to guess.

    ``cost_entry_is_bit_exact`` closed this for the ``output_mse`` branch: a
    weight-lossless entry on an activation-quantizing format keeps its measured
    A-side output_mse instead of short-circuiting to 0.0. But that branch is
    only taken when output_mse is a real measurement. Packed-expert rows whose
    routed forward could not be reconstructed (``can_measure_output`` false),
    and EVERY row in a run with ``PRISMAQUANT_EXPERT_COST_SAMPLE`` set, are
    written with ``output_mse_measured=False`` (measure_quant_cost), so pricing
    falls through to ``predicted_dloss``/``weight_mse`` — both of which are
    exactly 0.0 for a weight-lossless re-encode (the source is already in that
    format: MXFP4 over an MXFP4-packed source, NVFP4 over an NVFP4-CB source).
    Nothing in that row ever looked at the activation path, yet the DP reads a
    cost of 0.0: the unbeatable global minimum at any budget, for an assignment
    whose served activations are 4-bit.

    This is not a mis-estimate to be corrected — a positive weight-side
    surrogate is the accepted L1 design, biased but tradeable — it is a cost the
    optimizer CANNOT trade off: zero is the argmin, so the format is selected at
    every target, unconditionally. The unknown must therefore be excluded from
    the menu (``build_candidates``, counted and logged like any other
    inapplicable format) rather than priced.

    The predicate is exact, not thresholded:

      * the format's activation path is provably non-identity
        (``FormatSpec.act_quant_changes_input`` — a dtype-level fact);
      * no measured output-side evidence exists for this row
        (``_has_measured_output_mse``), so the A-side error is unknown
        whatever produced the number;
      * the resulting price is exactly 0.0 — the DP's global optimum;
      * the row's measured sensitivity is POSITIVE. ``h_trace == 0`` prices
        every format at 0.0 including the passthrough ones, which is a measured
        statement that no perturbation of this Linear's output moves the loss —
        W-side or A-side, since the same Fisher expansion multiplies both. A
        zero-token expert at thin calibration is exactly that row, and it must

    weight-only disagreement is a different question.

    A row joins the calibration sample when it carries BOTH estimators —
    a real measured ``output_mse`` (``_has_measured_output_mse``) AND a
    weight-only field, both strictly positive. Exactly-zero prices are
    excluded on both sides: a zero denominator has no ratio, and a zero

    already own.

    The membership test here is ``_has_measured_output_mse`` and must STAY
    that, even though pricing now asks the broader ``_prices_from_output_mse``.
    The two questions genuinely differ: a band-interpolated row's
    ``output_mse`` is a fit THROUGH this family's own measured anchors, so
    letting it into the sample would fit the measured-over-weight-only
    transfer constant partly on its own output — circular, and it would pull
    the constant toward whatever the interpolator already assumed. It is good
    enough to price the row it belongs to and not good enough to define the
    constant other rows are priced by; those are different bars, and this is
    the one place that has to hold the higher one.

    Consequence worth naming: ``weight_only_rows_by_family`` now counts some
    rows that pricing sends down the output-space branch, so it slightly
    OVER-counts the population the family penalty is actually applied to. That
    count only feeds ``calibrate``'s fail-closed refusal, where over-counting
    can make the run refuse more eagerly but never less — the safe direction —
    so it is left alone rather than split into a third census that would have
    to be kept in sync with the pricing precedence.

    Everything is computed at ``gain=1.0`` (the ratio is gain-invariant) and
    the iteration order is the sorted cost table, so the sample — and its
    digest — is deterministic.

    A Tessera family addresses a rate axis at a 1/256-bpp quantum, so one unit
    can carry thousands of legal rungs where a stock menu carries five. Two
    reductions apply, and they are kept apart because they license different
    claims and a receipt has to be able to say which one made a result look
    coarse:

    * **dominance** (``tessera_menu.prune_dominated``) drops a rung only when
      another is no larger in BYTES and no larger in COST. Exact for any
      knapsack whatsoever. Explicitly not a convex hull: the budget is
      discrete, so a point strictly inside the hull can still be the optimum
      at one particular remaining capacity, and hull pruning drops exactly
      those points.
    * **bin collapse** (``tessera_menu.collapse_to_dp_bins``) drops a rung
      only when another lands in the same charged bin of THIS DP
      (``_charged_bins`` at ``bit_precision``, against the unit's own cheapest
      candidate, which is the baseline ``solve_allocation`` uses). Exact for
      this solver at this precision and no stronger; skipped entirely when
      ``bit_precision`` is None.

    Non-Tessera candidates are never touched -- they are partitioned out
    before either reduction and concatenated back after -- so a run with no
    Tessera rung on the menu is byte-identical to one built before this
    function existed.

    This is the optimizer's first legality gate. Export keeps a final
    defensive check for stale or hand-written recipes, but the DP must never
    see choices that the selected serving profile cannot run.

    When ``source_manifest`` is present, every census kind must resolve to a
    registered source footprint owner and each candidate's exact additive
    tensor payload must be no larger than that source payload.  An absent
    manifest is the explicit legacy/offline mode; a partial or unknown
    manifest fails rather than silently omitting an unpriceable unit.

    ``activation_pricing`` (ultraplan P5a) is the run's ONE per-family
    activation calibration; it corrects the weight-only branches and stamps
    the branch that priced every candidate. ``target_profile``'s declared
    serving lanes (P5b) are resolved once per format and explicit serving
    context, then attached to every candidate, so the concrete route —
    activation contract, whether the
    consumer's fused mid-M kernel backs this rung, fallback — travels WITH
    the choice instead of being reconstructed from the format name later.
    A v5 contract requires each unit's context from ``context_by_unit``; an
    absent entry remains unbound and cannot borrow another unit's attestation.
    An explicit context also binds a legacy lookup: a schema without runtime
    scope cannot admit that query merely because it does not require one.

    A fused group is ONE module to the runtime, so what its members may
    disagree about is a fact about that runtime, and it arrives here as
    ``licence`` -- the pinned Tessera contract's ``fused_module`` block,
    parsed (``tessera_runtime_contract.FusedModuleLicence``), read through
    ``tessera_menu.fused_module_licence`` and checked on the Tessera side
    against the loader's own ``scheme.FUSED_MODULE_FIELDS``.  It is **never** a
    literal in this file. ``None`` means no applicable licence was supplied,
    rather than a permissive default. Production can supply the licence from
    the reviewed commit-and-contract pin; a release tag is not required.
    This function used to assert the licence in its own docstring ("they can
    disagree about the rate"), which is the field shape principle 14 forbids:
    no gate can read a docstring, so nothing refused when the runtime changed
    its mind, and a contract that re-tightened ``q256`` would have left the
    fold enumerating rungs the exporter refuses with nothing raising until
    export.

    Two things follow from reading it rather than asserting it, and they point
    in opposite directions:

    * ``q256: per_member`` is the licence for the fold at all.  Withdraw it --
      ``licence`` absent, or ``q256`` marked ``shared`` -- and this returns no
      options, so the group keeps the per-NAME intersection the caller already
      built, which asserts nothing per member.  A ``shared`` field the fold
      cannot evaluate is a refusal, not a skip
      (:func:`_fused_group_licence`).
    * the ``shared`` fields **narrow the fold**, and holding the family fixed
      is not enough to honour them.  The wire is
      ``tessera.export.wire_recipe(grid, q256)``: a function of the rung, not
      of the family.  On ``E2M1x2`` it flips at the TCQ cap -- rungs below 896
      write a WINDOW body, 896 writes TCQ -- so a family-only fold could put
      two ``body`` values in one module, and ``body`` is ``shared``.  The fold
      therefore runs per **coherence class**: the members' menus are keyed by
      :func:`tessera_formats.fused_shared_signature`, which evaluates exactly
      the shared fields a rung decides, and only rungs in one class are summed.
      A contract that later frees ``body`` widens the classes on its own.

    Why the fold, once a class is fixed: ``q_proj`` (2048x1024) and ``k_proj``
    (1024x1024) are different tensors with different sensitivities fused into
    one ``qkv_proj``, and a continuous rate axis whose group units are pinned
    to one shared rung throws that away.  The old aggregation intersected the
    members' menus by format NAME, which forces exactly that: on a
    measured-only Tessera table the qkv E4M3 intersection was a single rung.
    For each class, the group's option set is the **Minkowski sum** of its
    members' (bytes, cost) menus restricted to that class -- the group's own
    multi-choice knapsack -- kept as a Pareto set.  The outer DP then chooses
    among those options exactly as it chooses among rungs of a single unit.

    Exact, not approximate:

    * the fold is a full cross product at each step, Pareto-pruned by
      **dominance** (never a hull -- see ``_pareto_frontier``), so no option
      the DP could have wanted is discarded;
    * costs are summed from the members' own ``Candidate.predicted_dloss``,
      the same numbers the DP would charge if the members were separate units,
      so a uniform-rung option prices identically to the old per-NAME
      aggregation (asserted by the caller);
    * mixed-rung composites retain their existing ``z > 0`` refusal. The
      conservative uncertainty bound on uniform groups does not establish
      support for uncertainty repricing across this separate option path.

    Each group gets one super item carrying two kinds of option: one per stock
    format NAME, from the intersection of the members' menus (a stock format
    is one thing to the runtime, so the members must share it); and, for each
    Tessera coherence class the members share, the group's own exact
    multi-choice knapsack over their rungs
    (:func:`tessera_group_composites`) -- one decoder across the group, a rate
    per member. The second kind exists because a Tessera rung is a family and
    a rate glued into one name and only the first is a dispatch property;
    intersecting by name forced a shared rate that no runtime asks for, and on
    a continuous axis that collapsed a group's whole menu to whatever single
    rung its members happened to share.

    **Which fields the members may disagree about is READ, not assumed**
    (prismaquant #132): the pinned Tessera contract's ``fused_module`` block
    is loaded once per aggregation, through ``tessera_menu``'s declared one
    read, and passed down. ``None`` -- no contract pinned, which is production
    -- means the second kind of option does not exist at all, and a class the
    members share only rescues an empty NAME intersection while the contract
    frees the rate per member.

    A group whose members share neither a legal format NOR a Tessera coherence
    class the contract frees is a HARD ERROR, not a fallback to individual
    rows. Fused siblings (q/k/v, gate/up) must load
    under ONE format — that is a serving invariant, not a preference — so
    members with disjoint menus cannot be coherently promoted at all: whatever
    format whole-group promotion lands on is illegal for at least one member,
    and ``compute_achieved`` now refuses to price that state (AssertionError,
    at every target) rather than scoring the unpriced member at zero Δloss.
    Individual rows would therefore only defer the same failure past the solve,

    A packed serving group (``profile.packed_expert_format_group``) is
    atomic at serve time: vLLM's FusedMoE loads every projection of every
    routed expert in a layer under ONE quantization scheme, so a "one row
    upgraded" DP decision is not a real option — the serving constraint
    charges the whole group. Pricing upgrades per row inside the DP while
    ``promote_serving_units`` charges the whole group is a ~1000x price
    mismatch: mispriced expert rows
    top the per-bin ranking, the feasibility tightening over-corrects, and
    cheap-to-upgrade dense rows starve while headroom goes unused.

    This pre-pass makes each packed group ONE multi-choice DP item whose
    per-format cost is the exact sum of member predicted_dloss and whose
    byte cost is the exact sum of member bytes at that format — so the DP
    and the serving constraint price identical moves and post-DP MoE
    promotion becomes a validated no-op. Only formats legal for EVERY
    member are offered (member candidate sets already encode source /
    profile / kernel-shape applicability).

    A group with NO common legal format falls back to individual rows, which
    keeps it visible and attributable instead of silently vanishing from the
    DP — but that state is NOT allocatable and the fallback does NOT "repair
    coherence". Members can only be assigned from their own (by definition
    disjoint) candidate lists, so whole-group promotion necessarily lands on a
    format that is illegal for at least one member, and ``compute_achieved``
    refuses to price it (AssertionError, at every target) rather than scoring
    the unpriced member at zero Δloss — which would make the illegal state
    look CHEAPEST to the min-Δloss ratchet. An empty intersection is an
    upstream cost/legality bug to fix (a missing cost row, an over-tight
    applicability mask, a passthrough-source mismatch), not a state to
    allocate around.

    Non-grouped rows (attention, shared/dense MLP) pass through untouched.
    Extrapolated expert cost rows are ordinary members. Use
    ``expand_packed_group_assignment`` to broadcast a group decision back
    to per-tensor entries for emission.
