"""Exact serialized bytes for one Tessera Linear, from Tessera's own layout.

This replaces ``trellis_footprint`` (archived 2026-09-02 under
``archive/trellis_wire_2026-09-02/``, #118) in the allocator's byte path.  The
two are not ports of each other and must not be: ``trellis_footprint`` prices the
``gridbook.trellis.wire.v1`` layout -- an 88-byte binary header, its own row
alignment and block-offset rules -- and Tessera has a different wire
(``prismaquant.tessera.v1``) with a different plane set.  Re-deriving Tessera's
byte count here from Gridbook's model would produce a number that no exporter
would ever write.

So nothing here counts bytes. ``tessera.layout`` does, through the shared
plane/terminal extent arithmetic used by the artifact writer. Older producers
expose that arithmetic through ``build_planes`` / ``build_terminal``; newer
ones also expose payload-free extent builders. This module arranges the call
and reports the result. That is deliberate: the
allocator's byte budget, the accountant's figures and the exported artifact
have to be one number, and the only way to guarantee that is to have one
implementation of it.

The allocator reads four fields -- ``exact_bpw``, ``format``, ``shape`` and
``total_bytes``.  The rest is provenance, carried so a priced candidate can be
audited back to the planes it was priced from.

    The size question asked without the report: same family, same rung, same
    recipe, same arithmetic as :func:`tessera_tensor_payload_breakdown` --
    literally the same call -- so a rung cannot be priced one way for a
    ``FormatSpec`` and another way for an allocator candidate.  It is the
    ``layout="tight"``, canonical-schedule, zero-sidecar figure, which is what
    a format-level price is: a sidecar header belongs to a unit, not to a
    format.

    This is the answer for a wire the shape-free accountant cannot state -- a
    CHANNEL plane charges one fp16 per output row, a WINDOW body charges a
    ``2**L``-byte table per unit -- and it is exact for every other wire too.

    A packed ``(experts, out, in)`` stack is priced as ``experts`` units of
    ``(out, in)``, each paying its own window table and its own row field,
    because that is what the wire does rather than a convention chosen here:
    ``tessera.export.export_checkpoint_streaming`` encodes one unit per source
    tensor name and every source ships ``experts.{i}.*`` as separate 2-D
    tensors, the trellis runs down rows within a column so a fused
    ``(experts*out, in)`` unit would carry the path across expert boundaries
    and no single expert could be decoded alone, and the kernel lane decodes a
    unit against its own table (``_pack_window_unit``).  It is also the rule
    ``FormatSpec.scale_count_for_shape`` already applies to a stacked tensor:
    outer count times the per-matrix figure.  Anything that is not 2-D or 3-D
    is **refused** (as a ``ValueError``, which every caller of
    ``memory_bytes_for_shape`` in the tree already treats as "this format
    cannot take this tensor") rather than flattened into a rate.
