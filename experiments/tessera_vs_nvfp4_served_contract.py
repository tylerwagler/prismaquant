"""Contract-matched: Tessera(W4A16) @ 4.0 bpp vs NVFP4(W4A4) @ 4.5 bpp.

The weight-space screen in ``tessera_vs_nvfp4_glm_experts.py`` compares two
dequantized weights.  That is not how either format serves.  On the GLM route
NVFP4 runs **W4A4** -- ``flashinfer_b12x`` quantizes the activation to FP4 too
-- while the Tessera kernel lane decodes to bf16 weights and consumes a bf16
activation (W4A16), exactly as EXL3 does.  Pricing NVFP4 without its activation
leg prices it as it does not deploy, which is the mistake
``tessera-scale-plane-is-not-a-neutral-control`` records in the other
direction.

So this measures the functional error each format actually delivers:

    y_ref = X @ W.T                                   (bf16 source, fp32 math)
    NVFP4 W4A4 = qdq_act(X, G) @ qdq_w(W).T           (as served)
    NVFP4 W4A16 = X @ qdq_w(W).T                      (decomposition only)
    Tessera    = X @ W_tessera.T                      (as served, kernel lane)

NVFP4's weight leg is rendered by the **production** path (GPTQ +
static_act_order + JSO), not RTN, so neither leg of the NVFP4 arm is
handicapped.  **The activation tokens are split.**  GPTQ fits its Hessian on
``X_fit`` and the static ``G`` is calibrated on ``X_fit``; every arm is scored
on the disjoint ``X_eval``.  Scored in-sample, GPTQ's render looked 3.3x better
than RTN -- a number that would have flattered NVFP4 exactly the way this
project's damp_sweep evaluator once did.  Tessera's encoder sees no activations
at all, so without the split the two arms were not even measured on the same
footing.  The render is asserted to differ from RTN before it is scored:
``render_activations_keyed_by_qname`` records that a wrong activation key
silently falls back to RTN and raises nothing.

``X`` is *real* cached routed-expert input activations from the GLM-5.3-Flash
BF16 probe, not a synthetic draw -- the distinction that
``tessera-source-model-must-match-the-encoder`` exists to enforce.  ``G`` is
chosen by the production policy ``select_mse_grid_input_global_scale``, which
minimizes serve-QDQ MSE, so the NVFP4 activation leg is at its *best* static
setting.  (An earlier draft of this docstring also claimed "NVFP4's weight leg
remains RTN".  It does not -- the code renders it through
``render_production_weight`` with gptq/static_act_order/joint_scale_opt, and
asserts the result differs from RTN before scoring.  The stale sentence
contradicted the paragraph above it and is removed.)  The remaining asymmetry
runs the other way: Tessera's arm is plain -- no rotation, no diagonals, worth
~1% on the weight screen -- so both NVFP4 legs are at production best and
Tessera's is not.

Scope limit: the probe caches one input per packed-expert entry, at hidden dim,
so this covers gate_proj/up_proj only.  down_proj consumes the intermediate
activation, which was not cached, and is excluded -- roughly a third of expert
params are therefore unpriced here.  And this is a functional screen on cached
activations, not a served KL: principle 3 says it selects nothing.
