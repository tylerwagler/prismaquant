# Frontier destination metadata ownership — 2026-09-08

Tracking issue: [#421](https://github.com/RobTand/prismaquant/issues/421).

A new validated assignment could inherit the overwritten allocator recipe's
Tessera wire/scale/population and serving/runtime claims. The selector now
requires complete canonical assignment equality before carrying those fields;
a changed assignment refuses before writing the layer config, assignment or
summary. Equivalent format string/AutoRound dictionary spellings still match.
The existing selected-payload CB and whole-artifact budget ownership is retained.

This is a fail-closed repair. It does not add selected Tessera metadata to the
allocator Pareto producer or the validator's resolved payload. Until that
handoff is implemented, each Tessera recipe must use the allocator's own final
metadata and selected-wire gates. No performance or serving claim is made.

## Root integration review

Root reviewed the changed selector, all eight regression cases, both incidental
allocator comments and the intake helper. The actual negative source snapshot
has the unchanged regression tests and the original selector; its seven wrong
successful writes and unchanged-assignment control were verified in the hashed
attempt log. The green and compile snapshots match the supplied code; their
other differences are receipt/report files and the sizing helper. Canonical CAS
receipt bodies, payload digests, source bundles and terminal cleanup were checked
independently.

Integration `86e85c0eaf` retains all derivative, dispatch and selector architecture
stamps. Runtime and regression files are byte-identical to the reviewed branch.
The combined documentation gates passed 19 tests across two PB CPU shards
(1 CPU, 2 GiB each, native threads 1): `c4409bfe817e` and `fb28082f1b8f`. Their
source snapshots differ from that integration only by the PB closure record;
actual outputs and cleanup passed. The subsequent intake-only clarification
distinguishes direct served candidate comparison from optional runtime-v2
prediction, and calls the reviewed Tessera PR head a head rather than a merge.
No new GPU, export, probe or serving result is implied.
