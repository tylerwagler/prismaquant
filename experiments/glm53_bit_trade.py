"""REFUTED 2026-09-01, same day.  Superseded by ``glm53_expert_menu.py``.

Its gain leg buys ``TESSERA_E4M3_K1_R951`` as a "4.2148 bpp" rung.  Two facts
kill that: body and completion sum to the cap, so a Tessera family has ONE
size and that rung actually weighs **7.5 bpp**; and its grid digest is not in
``SERIALISABLE_GRIDS``, so it cannot be written at all.  There is no
serialisable Tessera rung between 4.0 and 8, and the freed bytes therefore buy
a *format change on a subset of layers*, not a rate.  The verdict survives at
7.7x instead of 10.7x -- see
``tessera/docs/measurements/glm53-bit-trade-2026-09-01.md``.

Kept runnable because its COST leg (non-expert body BF16 -> FP8_E4M3) is
unaffected and is still the source of the 0.018207 figure.  Do not cite its
gain leg.

Original docstring follows.

Is the trade good?  Measure both sides of "FP8 attention buys expert bits".

``docs/measurements/glm53-body-budget-2026-09-01.md`` shows that Mia leaves
15.44 GiB at 16 bpp on 2.6% of GLM's parameters, and that pricing attention and
``lm_head`` at FP8 frees 7.692 GiB -- worth **+0.2171 bpp on the routed
experts** at identical total size.  That is byte arithmetic.  It says the trade
is *available*; it does not say it is *good*.

This measures both sides on real cached activations:

    cost  : other_body Linears, BF16 -> FP8_E4M3       (what the trade spends)
    gain  : expert Linears, 4.0000 bpp -> 4.2285 bpp   (what the trade buys)

Both in the same currency -- relative functional error on ``y = X W^T``, which
is what the activations make measurable -- so the two legs are comparable
without a Fisher weighting that would import a second set of assumptions.

**The expert rungs are not the same family.**  ``TESSERA_E2M1_K2`` caps at
exactly 4.000 bpp (``q256`` max 896), so the higher rung cannot come from it;
``TESSERA_E4M3_K1`` was believed to be the only *serialisable* family
covering the band -- WRONG, its digest is not committed, and nothing covers
the band (the
LM* Lloyd-Max families reach it but have no wire identity -- their values are
fitted to the tensor and no identifier reproduces them).  So the gain leg is
also a family change, and that is stated rather than hidden: it is what the
allocator would actually have to pick.

Held out throughout: FP8 and Tessera see no activations, but the reference and
every arm are scored on ``X_eval``, disjoint from the ``X_fit`` half, so this
harness cannot be flattered by an in-sample render the way the damp_sweep
evaluator once was.
