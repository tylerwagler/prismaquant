"""Compute a per-row data manifest for each row of a pbcampaign manifest.

Why this exists
---------------
PrismaBuild issue #487 gives an action a second content-addressed input, a
*data manifest*: the exact files and byte ranges the action will read off the
shared mount, so a storage-role fleet loop can pull them into the dl380g10 ARC
before the row is claimed. W3 measured the payoff -- an ARC-resident row reads
at 3298.7 MB/s against 306.9 MB/s cold, 10.75x -- but only if the *right* bytes
are resident, and only the producer knows which those are.

This tool is the producer side. It reuses the read-set expansion that the W3
prewarm daemon already validated (``glm_arc_prewarm.Campaign``): the 864
capture files a row's members name, in the order ``prefetch_capture`` consumes
them (sorted member name), plus the coalesced byte ranges of those members'
weight tensors inside the safetensors shards. It writes one manifest per row
and a NEW pbcampaign manifest carrying ``data_manifest`` per row. The input
manifest is never rewritten.

Exact identity, not globs
-------------------------
Every entry names one file and, for a weight shard, one byte range. Nothing is
expanded at consume time, so the prewarm loop reads exactly what the producer
priced and a reviewer can diff the manifest against the row.

Per-file ``sha256`` is deliberately ``null``. Hashing this campaign's 1023 GB of
capture bytes would cost more than the prewarm saves, and the contract does not
need it: the *manifest file* is content-addressed in the PrismaBuild CAS, which
is what binds the action key to this byte list. The manifest is a residency
hint, not an integrity claim about the data, and it says so in its own schema.

Capture sizes come from a cached inventory (``--sizes-cache``, one
``<basename> <bytes>`` line per file) so that generating 16 manifests does not
stat 36,423 files over NFS. Pass ``--stat`` to stat instead.
