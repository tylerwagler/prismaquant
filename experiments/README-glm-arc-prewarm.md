Two programs, both aimed at one number: the ~1.83 Gbit/s a campaign row gets
while it reads its 864 capture files and its layer's weights off dl380g10.

## The problem

The census reads its whole 1.894 TiB capture working set exactly once, spread
over 132 rows of ~49.4 GB each, through a server whose ARC is ~200 GB. A byte
is read once and never asked for again, so no caching policy applied *after* a
read can help. The only fast read is one that was already resident, and the only
time available to make it resident is the ~1.8 hours the current row spends on
the GPU after its own load finishes.

## `glm_pool_read_ceiling.py` — is 204 MB/s the pool or the client?

Reads disjoint prefixes of already-priced expert rows straight off the local
pool mount in a forward-and-back sweep -- 1, 4, 8, 16, 16, 8, 4, 1 -- so the
spread between a reader count's two arms is the error bar on a box shared with
other PrismaBuild work. Each arm gets its own set, so no arm warms another.
arcstats, per-arm ARC/L2ARC counter deltas, box `/proc/diskstats`, loadavg, the
count of other actions holding the box, and every relevant
`/sys/module/zfs/parameters` value are recorded on both sides.

**Coldness is judged from `l2_hits` against `l2_misses` per arm, plus box HDD
read bytes against the arm's logical bytes.** The `cold` flag the script derives
from `/proc/self/io read_bytes` is kept for the record but is **not** a valid
test: on ZFS `read_bytes` is the ZPL's own accounting, not physical I/O, and it
reads above the box-wide total on some arms. An arm with `l2_misses = 0` was
served from the L2ARC NVMe and measures that device, not the raidz1.

Run it through PrismaBuild, pinned to the server:

```bash
python3 /mnt/shared/prismabuild-fleet/repo/tools/pbrun.py \
  --cwd /home/rob/tmp/pq-glm-arc-prewarm \
  --tag dl380g10 --cpus 4 --demand mem_gb=4 \
  --priority -10 --timeout-s 3000 --detach \
  -- /home/rob/venvs/pq-cpu312/bin/python experiments/glm_pool_read_ceiling.py \
     --out <BASE>/arc-prewarm-20260910/pool-read-ceiling-01.json
```

`glm_pool_read_ceiling_arms.json` holds the arm definitions, so the file sets
travel in the action's snapshot and the measurement is reproducible.

## `glm_arc_prewarm.py` — the prewarm daemon

Predicts which rows run next, derives exactly what each will read, and pulls
those bytes into ARC ahead of the row.

**Prediction.** It reads PrismaBuild's ready queue and reproduces PB's own claim
order — `(-priority, -passes, published_unix)`, from `prismabuild/pool.py` — then
keeps the items that resolve to a row of this campaign. An action key becomes a
row id through the sealed CAS request's argv (`--units .../units/row-XXXX.json`);
a roster file is only a fallback. It predicts *which rows*, never which box:
placement is PrismaBuild's and happens at claim time, so warming the top
`window x (GPU hosts)` ready rows is correct whichever Spark claims first.

**Read set.** Per row: the capture files named by the campaign's capture
manifest, in the order `prefetch_capture` consumes them (sorted member name);
the byte ranges of the layer's selected weight tensors inside the safetensors
shards, parsed from each shard's header and coalesced to 1 MiB record
boundaries, because `--source-snapshot-policy selected-tensors-v1` reads ranges
rather than whole shards; and the seed bytes the row's own argv names --
`--seed-checkpoint` with its `.parts` shards, and every regular file under the
directory `--seed-wire-dir` names, enumerated with `os.scandir` of that
directory and the directories below it, and nothing above it. A row whose
named wire directory yields no readable file is refused rather than submitted
with `seeds: 0`, counting that directory's own files so a checkpoint that
exists cannot stand in for a missing wire.

The seed term is read off the argv, not off the campaign's plan. A row seeded
from a `--seed-workspace` records its seed in `plan.json`; a campaign seeded
from the global `--seed-checkpoint` / `--seed-wire-dir` flags records neither
per row, and the directory those flags name belongs to a different workspace.
Reading the plan is what made every manifest of `extension-r1024-02` declare
`seeds: 0` while the row spent minutes hashing 9.4-19 GB of wire at 41 MB/s off
cold spindles (row-0065, 2026-09-12). Seeds come last in `entries`, after the
captures and the weight extents, because that is the order the row reads them:
`prewarm_loop`'s reader walks the list in order and can stop at a byte budget,
so a warm cut short loses the bytes the row reads last.

**Safety.** It holds off while any claimed row is still inside its own load
phase, detected by the immutable `capture-load-execution-<sha>.json` the row
writes beside its cache (with a `--load-grace-s` fallback), so the current row's
still-needed files are never evicted for the next row's. It reads ARC `size`
against `c_max` and spends at most `--arc-reserve-fraction` of the headroom. It
opens PrismaBuild queue files read-only and never writes one, and logs only
`action_key -> row_id -> bytes`, never raw queue or CAS records.

### Modes

```bash
# what would be warmed, given the live queue (no reads)
python experiments/glm_arc_prewarm.py --once --dry-run

# the same against a hypothetical ready set
python experiments/glm_arc_prewarm.py --once --dry-run \
    --simulate-ready row-0065,row-0084,row-0064

# one row, for real (the acceptance warm)
python experiments/glm_arc_prewarm.py --warm-row row-0079 --readers 8

# service
systemd-run --user --unit glm-arc-prewarm \
  /home/rob/venvs/pq-cpu312/bin/python experiments/glm_arc_prewarm.py --daemon --dry-run
```

Switch a dry-run service to live warming by stopping the unit and starting it
without `--dry-run`:

```bash
systemctl --user stop glm-arc-prewarm
systemd-run --user --unit glm-arc-prewarm \
  /home/rob/venvs/pq-cpu312/bin/python experiments/glm_arc_prewarm.py \
    --daemon --readers 8 --window 1
```

### Cost to watch

ARC growth is charged against `/proc/meminfo` `MemAvailable` on dl380g10 roughly
one for one: a measured 49.3 GB warm took it from 145.9 GB to 88.4 GB. Warming a
64 GB row therefore tightens memory on the fleet's only 80-CPU box for everyone
else.

`observed_capacity.mem_gb` in `pb-queue/workers/dl380g10.json` is **not** the
field to watch. `prismabuild/pool.py:1953-1970` defines it as a windowed offer
with foreign (PB-unscheduled) work subtracted, lagging by up to
`--observe-samples` polls; across a measured +56 GB warm it moved 127 -> 159,
i.e. the wrong way. Read `/proc/meminfo` on the box instead, before and after.

Netdata's `mem.available` for dl380g10 is a third number again -- it adds ARC
back as reclaimable and sat near 270 GB through the same warm. Name the source
whenever quoting one of these.
