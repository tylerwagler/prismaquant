"""Warm the dl380g10 ARC with the capture and weight bytes the next campaign
row will read, while the current row is still on the GPU.

Status: SUPERSEDED as a daemon
------------------------------
The warming *loop* now lives in PrismaBuild as the fleet's storage role,
``tools/fleet/prewarm_loop.py`` (issue #487, PR #494), which reads the same
data manifests this file's ``glm_data_manifests.py`` sibling emits, out of the
queue's own claim order, on the box that holds the pool.  It belongs there:
prewarm is a property of the fleet's storage, not of one campaign, and a
second dispatcher predicting the same claim order is exactly the duplication
the fleet's own rules forbid.

What stays useful here is everything the loop does not do: the pool-ceiling
and NFS read rigs that measured the tiers, the manifest builder, and the
dry-run queue rig.  ``--daemon`` is kept so the measurements remain
reproducible and so the running dry-run unit on dl380g10 can be read back; it
is not the thing to deploy.  Retirement of that unit is step 1 of the W3
switchover runbook (``SWITCHOVER.md``, kept with the W3 evidence outside this
repo).

Why this exists
---------------
Every row of the GLM-5.3-Flash Tessera census opens its 864 capture files and
its layer's weight tensors exactly once, at row start, and the campaign's whole
working set (1.894 TiB of captures) is far larger than the server's ARC. Caching
after the fact therefore never helps: a byte is read once and never asked for
again. The only read that can be made fast is one that was already resident
before the row started, so the lever is to spend the current row's ~1.8 hours of
GPU time pulling the *next* row's bytes off the HDDs.

What it does
------------
1. Reads PrismaBuild's ready queue and reproduces its claim order
   (``-priority``, ``-passes``, ``published_unix``; see
   ``prismabuild/pool.py:2895-2901``), keeping only items that resolve to a row of
   this campaign.
2. Resolves each action key to a row id from the sealed CAS request's argv
   (``--units .../units/row-XXXX.json``), falling back to a roster file. It
   never writes to the queue and never logs raw queue or CAS records.
3. Derives the row's read set: the 864 capture files named by the campaign's
   capture manifest, in the order ``prefetch_capture`` consumes them (sorted
   member name), plus the byte ranges of the layer's weight tensors inside the
   safetensors shards, coalesced to record boundaries.
4. Reads them off the local pool path with bounded parallelism, stopping when
   ARC headroom runs out and holding off while a claimed row is still in its
   own load phase.

Placement stays PrismaBuild's: this predicts *which rows run next*, not which
box gets them, so the warmed set is correct whichever Spark claims first.
